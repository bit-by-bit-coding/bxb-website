        <p>Uncommon Sense is a free weekly program launched in partnership with <a
                href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/ea/">Stanford Effective Altruism</a> for curious
            highschoolers interested in learning ways to
            form hypotheses about the world and make decisions that effectively accomplish their goals.
            Students will match wits with AIs, instructors, and each other as they explore topics like cognitive
            psychology,
            game theory, prediction markets, and so much more!

            Neural Logical is a free two-week summer camp that teaches highschoolers to use AI to solve real world problems
            such as identifying tumors in MRI scans. Students will use their knowledge of Python to create their own neural 
            networks (the most popular machine learning technique) in the Keras framework. By the end of the camp, students 
            will understand how a neural network works, the math behind it, and how to build one of their very own!
