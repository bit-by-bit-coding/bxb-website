        <p>I am Sydney Von Arx, and I love to code! I’m a computer science major at Stanford. I have experience
            with eight programming languages. I have completed three computer science-related internships and
            built several programs and apps. My real specialty, though, is web development. One of the few
            things I love more than coding is teaching!</p>

        <p><strong class="author">Selena Zhang</strong></p>
        <p>I’m Selena Zhang, and coding is my passion! I plan to study computer science at MIT next year. I’ve
            studied quantum computing and robotics under Professor Perkowski at PSU, but I got my start with web
            development! I love teaching and learning from others, and I’ve devoted hundreds of hours to
            teaching after-school programs throughout high school.</p>
