    <h2>// Hello World</h2>

    <div id="intro">
        <p id="introtext">Hello World is a one-week camp for motivated girls to learn to build their own websites, getting down-and-dirty with real code. Every camper will learn the principles of front-end web development and the heart of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Moreover, she’ll get the techniques, resources, and passion to continue tinkering with code for the rest of her life! The program is in its third year and is made possible by a grant from Thermo Fisher Scientific.</p>

<h2>//About the Instructors</h2>
<div>
    <p><strong class="author">Sydney Von Arx</strong></p>
    <p>I am Sydney Von Arx, and I love to code! I’m a computer science major at Stanford.  I have experience with eight programming languages. I have completed three computer science-related internships and built several programs and apps. My real specialty, though, is web development. One of the few things I love more than coding is teaching!</p>

    <p><strong class="author">Selena Zhang</strong></p>
    <p>I’m Selena Zhang, and coding is my passion! I plan to study computer science at MIT next year. I’ve studied quantum computing and robotics under Professor Perkowski at PSU, but I got my start with web development! I love teaching and learning from others, and I’ve devoted hundreds of hours to teaching after-school programs throughout high school.</p>
