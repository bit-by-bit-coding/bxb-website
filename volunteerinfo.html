    <h2>Bit by Bit Central</h2>
    <p>
        The commitment levels for this team are fairly flexible, but the average time commitment is anywhere
        from 1 to 3 hours a week depending on how invested you are. Within the central organization,
        there are several smaller teams: Marketing, Website Design, Fundraising and Software Engineer.
        However, keep in mind that we may create new teams if we have other avenues we want to pursue
        such as new projects or programs!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in and are accepted to this team, it may be a little more time commitment
        in the beginning to get you all set up. This would involve meetings with the Central Organization Coordinator
        and meetings with the Team Lead!

    <p>The goal is to teach middle schoolers how to code an interactive website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through an
        after school program that will meet once a week. Volunteer commitment has flexibility dependent on which
        volunteer position you sign up for. The options are standard volunteer, homeroom instructor, and curriculum.

    <p>The afterschool program will be divided into homerooms. Each homeroom will focus on a different stage in learning
        web design. Students will follow an established pathway through the homerooms.

    <h2>Uncommon Sense Team</h2>
    <p>
        Uncommon Sense seeks to teach tools and techniques to ponder, question, probe, and develop decisions,
        beliefs, and actions. By default, your brain will decide whether or not a statement is true by looking
        at things like “how symmetrical is the face of the person telling me this?” “what accent does the person
        speaking have?” or “how many times have I heard this statement before?” We provide students with the
        community and toolkit (full of cognitive science, probability theory, decision theory, and more) necessary
        to try making their decisions more consciously and updating their beliefs based on the strength of the
        evidence presented.
    </p>
    <p>Volunteers should be ready to learn and practice the concepts we’ll teach. You should be skeptical, intrinsically
        motivated to seek out the truth, and eager to learn when you’re wrong.
    </p>

    <h3>General Outline</h3>
    <p>
        The program runs from 4-5pm PDT Wednesdays. Every four weeks will focus on exploring a different concept,
        with the final of the four weeks in a unit focused on implementing the idea and synthesising concepts.
        Volunteers should arrive at 3:30 and stay until 5:15. There will also be other meetings to plan
        and rehearse for roughly an hour a week (exact times and durations may change).
    </p>

    <h3>Teaching Volunteer</h3>
    <p>About 2 hours a week. Dive into specific activities, ideas, and games, mastering them well enough to teach.
        Engage with students ideas and inquiries.
    </p>

    <h3>Curriculum Volunteer</h3>
    <p>About 4 hours a week. Along with teaching, brainstorm, test, and refine activities for the program.
