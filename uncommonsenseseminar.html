                <strong>What is Uncommon Sense?</strong>
                Uncommon Sense Summer workshop is an <strong>all-expenses-paid</strong> one week workshop in California this summer
                offered in partnership with
                <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/ea/">
                    Stanford Effective Altruism</a>. 20
                students will be chosen from across the country to participate in this program, which is designed to
                teach students how to apply concepts from a myriad of fields, including cognitive science, economics,
                game theory, and machine learning. They will also have the opportunity to interact with speakers from
                <strong>Stanford University</strong>, <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong>, <strong>OpenAI</strong>, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dates and logistics of the in-person program are still somewhat flexible because we are constantly
                adapting to COVID. There is a chance we will have to move the program online, but for now we think the
                program is more likely to be in-person than online.

                The tentative dates are <strong>Aug 15th-21st</strong>.

                <summary>What, exactly, do you teach?</summary>
                <p>
                    Great question! The things we teach fall into two broad categories:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Instrumental Rationality: the skills you need to achieve your goals. What do you value for
                        its own sake? What are the things you want to achieve above all else, the things your other
                        actions are stepping-stones towards? These terminal goals could be happiness, improving the
                        world, becoming famous, anything. Now ask yourself what you did this past hour. Was it the
                        best possible action you could have taken to achieve your goals? We help you achieve your
                        goals by giving you tools that help you become accustomed to making plans and habits that
                        actually work and inch you in the direction you want to go.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Epistemic rationality: the use of evidence and reason to form accurate beliefs about the world.
                        Specific skills we will teach include Bayesian reasoning, statistics, epistemology, cognitive
                        biases, forecasting, and building models of complex systems. We teach epistemic rationality by
                        offering interesting and complex ideas for you to discuss, debate, and form beliefs about. We
                        also equip you with useful ideas that help you think clearly about uncertainty and complex
                        systems.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What do you mean by "beliefs"?</summary>
                <p>
                    When we say “belief,” we mean anything you think is true about the world. Something as simple as
                    “the
                    sky is blue” is a belief. So is something as controversial as “GMOs are safe to eat.” Beliefs are
                    not
                    indisputable Truths about the world--you can be very confident in some beliefs, but you should still
                    be
                    willing to change your mind about them based on evidence. If I go outside and see that the sky is
                    purple,
                    I might change my mind about believing the sky is blue. If I read a study that says many GMOs have
                    been
                    linked to cancer, I might change my mind about GMOs being safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people think their beliefs are infallible. They spend most of their time trying to persuade
                    other
                    people of their beliefs and very little of their time seeing if other people's beliefs persuade them
                    to
                    change their own opinions. But most people also fiercely disagree with each other about many of
                    their
                    core beliefs (X political party is best, Y religion is true, Z is the most important issue facing
                    humanity right now). So it stands to reason that many of them are simply wrong and unwilling to even
                    entertain this possibility. Uncommon Sense is for the people who think they could be wrong about
                    their
                    beliefs, people who seek out contrasting viewpoints to test their beliefs, people who see changing
                    their
                    beliefs as an opportunity to learn rather than as a personal attack.

                    If you are not already familiar with and interested in most of the following concepts, Uncommon
                    Sense might be for you:

                    <li>Bayesian reasoning</li>

                    Here are a few fun little puzzles that should give you a taste of the flavor of questions we
                    focus on:
                <ul>
                    <li>You are in a jury trying to decide whether or not to condemn someone for kidnapping and
                        ransoming an innocent man. Police are certain the perpetrator was one of 30 people staying
                        in a certain motel who match the basic demographics of the kidnapper and have weak alibis.
                        The businessperson then picked the accused out of a lineup. You know a perpetrator gets
                        correctly identified in a lineup about 60% of the time, and any given innocent person gets
                        identified about 10% of the time. Based on this evidence, what are the odds that the
                        accused is guilty? (<a href="https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq">hint</a>)

                    <li>
                        You are an economics professor who forgot to go to the ATM before leaving for work, and who
                        has only $20 in your pocket. You have a lunch meeting at a very expensive French restaurant,
                        but you're stuck teaching classes until lunchtime and have no way to get money. Can you trick
                        your students into giving you enough money for lunch in exchange for your $20, without lying
                        to them in any way?

                        , voting is never a rational choice for a self-interested individual to make because your
                        vote has a miniscule chance of influencing the election but there is a significant cost to
                        yourself to go out and vote. Yet, it’s possible that even a selfish person should go out
                        and vote. Why might this be?

                <p>
                    We are a team of Stanford students with experience in computer science, economics, machine
                    learning, and public policy. We have combined our own knowledge and experiences with select
                    ideas from cognitive science, economics, psychology, philosophy, computer science, and forecasting,
                    game theory, statistics, and many other fields. (These various disciplines may all seem disparate,
                    but they all provide useful tools that help instill what it means to think critically.) We
                    regularly
                    run programs to teach these concepts to Stanford students, and we developed our curriculum with
                    advice from people who have run workshops, summer camps, and seminars aimed at teaching critical
                    thinking techniques to professionals, high schoolers, and students at top universities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But at the end of the day, we don’t claim to be more rational or correct than anyone else. We think
                    we have some ideas people might find useful, ideas we’ve thought about and some ideas we’ve adapted
                    from organizations like <a href="https://www.rationality.org/">CFAR</a> (though we are not
                    affiliated
                    with them). We regularly try new teaching methods and are constantly and iterating, learning, and
                    improving. It seems like students in our programs agree, as does preliminary data we’ve been
                    collecting
                    about the efficacy of our program (though our sample size is small and we can’t implement a RCT).
                    We encourage you to be skeptical of everything we say and call us out if you think we’re wrong about
                    something.

                <p>
                    We’d love for you to apply and test the program out! If it’s not useful, you’re free to leave

                    We receive many wonderful applications, but unfortunately we can only accommodate a small number

                <summary>What does a typical day look like?</summary>
                <p>
                    Students start each day a morning meeting and breakfast. Then, we dive into the day’s concept. Each
                    day focuses on adding
                    a different tool to students’ repertoire, and weeks are grouped into monthly themes like
                    “statistics”
                    and “ethical frameworks.” There will be 1-2 discussions each day, 1-2 activities, and plenty of fun
                    and social events. There will also be time to work on projects or explore a concept from the day in
                    smaller groups.
                    Examples of discussion topics include: Game Theory as a Dark Art, Cognitive Biases
                    Speed-round, Intro to Forecasting, The Economics of Your Career Choice, and How to Read a
                    Scientific Study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Activities include: a cold war nuclear simulation,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt">stag hunts</a>, a walk through a map of moral
                    philosophies, a lottery with varying odds, and a chance to forecast when at least 10 million
                    Americans will receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

                <p>
                    We take COVID-19 very seriously. All instructors and guests will be vaccinated. While California
                    speakers will visit in-person, other speakers will be virtual to limit risks of transmission from
                    flights. Many students will be vaccinated, and all will be tested regularly during the program. We
                    will provide N-95s to all participants for their air travel and will offer masks throughout the
                    program to anyone who is not vaccinated. Non-vaccinated students will not share rooms and will be
                    asked to distance. All participants will track their <a

                <summary>What’s the difference between this program and the school-year program you offer?</summary>
                <p>
                    The summer seminar is a much more intense, interactive, and rigorous program than our
                    extracurricular offering. The summer program demands a much deeper level of intellectual engagement
                    that includes projects, write-ups, and readings. We feel these aspects are necessary to prepare
                    students to fully understand, utilize, and build off of the tools and concepts we teach. The summer
                    program also fosters a community of talented students who see eachother every day for discussions,
                    games, and collaborative projects. This kind of environment isn’t possible with a school-year
                    program that only meets for an hour a week.

                    feel that one of the best ways to do tat is by empowering high school students to tackle the world's
                    most pressing problems!

                <p>
                    We expect to have the location finalized within by 4/17. If we need to move online, we will inform
                    everyone as soon as possible. This will likely be no latter than July, though if something
                    unexpected happened (eg a new rapidly-spreading strain unaffected vy vaccination status), those
                    plans may have to change. if we move online, we will run the entire program virtually. The
                    curriculum
                    will be the same though adapted for the new format, and some meetings will be shorter or
                    asynchronous to avoid Zoom fatigue.

                <p>
                    We expect students to carve out plenty of time for or program during the weeks where it runs. The
                    full schedule will be announced soon, but in general, there will be several meetings lasting 30-120
                    minutes throughout the day. The hope is that this model will minimize “Zoom fatigue.” Some
                    activities will be mandatory, while others will be optional. There will also be asynchronous
                    activities like meetings with groups of other students to work on projects, independent readings,
                    time to write and think independently, and other challenges. We expect there to be about 1 hour of
                    required real-time activities, 2 hours of optional real-time activities, and 2 hours of asynchronous
                    work each weekday.

                <p>
                    Things that might make students a good fit for Uncommon Sense include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having agency: when faced with a challenge, do they come up with and pursue their own solutions
                        without being prompted or told to do so? Do they work on ambitious projects on their own?</li>
                    <li>Carefully thinking through their values and actions: when they make important decisions, do they
                        know precisely why they are making them?</li>
                    <li>A tendency to optimize for important goals: when they want to do something, do they plan out
                        their actions and consider many options? When shown a better way to do a difficult task, do they
                        adopt the new method? When they decide how to use their time or resources, do they think about
                        the alternative ways they could use these resources?</li>
                    <li>An affinity for truth: do they seek out ideas that challenge their opinions? If they find
                        evidence that contradicts their opinions, do they eagerly change their mind? Do they enjoy
                        learning end exploration?</li>
                    <li>Interest in rationality and cognition: do they want to improve their thinking? Do they enjoy
                        talking about cognitive biases, or reading about psychology, economics, AI, cognitive science,
                        philosophy, or a related subject?</li>
                    <li>A desire to make the world better: do they have a drive to achieve some lofty goal to improve
                        the world? Do they care about the details of this plan and are they taking steps to achieve it?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    A good applicant probably possesses at least three of these traits, though there are sure to be
                    plenty of exceptions. These are merely guidelines.

                <summary>Why do you require teacher nominations to apply?</summary>
                <p>
                    Our program is not suitable for all students. The pace is fast, the questions are tough, and the
                    work is demanding. We need students who thrive in tackling difficult questions, who value science
                    and knowledge, and who actually want to learn the material we offer rather than to collect a name
                    for their resume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, trying to figure out which students will thrive in our program is a difficult task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We could require students to write long essays and wax poetical about bayesian reasoning, but high
                    school students are already inundated with application essays to write, and the best essays tend to
                    only be a sign of good writing ability (and access to good education, familiarity with Standard
                    American English rather than African American Vernacular English, etc). Not of the holistic kind of
                    student we seek.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We could look at test scores, but these measure privilege and test-taking ability as much as they
                    measure academic prowess or intellect. Moreover, many students haven’t taken these exams, and they
                    don’t capture the traits we’re looking for very well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We could look at grades, but these can vary widely between schools, and again might reflect access
                    to tutors and other resources more than inherent ability. Plus, grades also don’t encompass the
                    traits we are looking for too well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instructors already have a holistic view of their students, and we trust their judgement much more
                    than any other metric. Applying this simple filter prevents students who aren’t a good fit from
                    needlessly filling out the application, and might encourage students who are a good fit but feel
                    insecure about their talents to apply. Obviously instructor nominations are not a perfect metric,
                    but they’re the best we have at the moment.
