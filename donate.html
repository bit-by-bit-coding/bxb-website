        <p>
            We thank you for considering donating to Bit by Bit! 100% of the money we receive through your donation 
            is invested directly back into improving the quality of our programs, offering new exciting summer 
            programs, creating interactive resources, and more. All donations are tax deductible and your receipt 
            is sent to you immediately. No amount is too small -- any donation will help us!
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you donate to us, however, please recognize
            there are other charities that save more lives per dollar than we can with your donation. We recommend
            that you consider donating to <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">a GiveWell charity</a> before donating to us. If you do not plan
            to donate to one of these highly effective charities instead, then we welcome your donation!
        </p>
