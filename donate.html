            We thank you for considering donating to Bit by Bit!
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you donate to us, however, please recognize there are other charities that save more lives per
            dollar than we can with your donation. We recommend that you consider donating to
            <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">a GiveWell charity</a> before donating to us. If you do not plan to
            donate
            to one of these highly effective charities instead, then we welcome your donation!
        </p>
        <p>
            Contribute directly below, or support us through <a

                100% of the money we receive through your donation is
                invested directly back into improving the quality of our programs, offering new exciting summer
                programs,
                creating interactive resources, and more. All donations are tax deductible and your receipt is sent to
                you
                immediately.
