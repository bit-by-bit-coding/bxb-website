        <p>Your donations are what keep Bit by Bit low-cost and high-quality! We recommend a donation of $20 for every
            month of Form and Function and/or Uncommon Sense you sign up for.</p>
        <p>Before you donate to us, however, please recognize
            there are other charities that save more lives per dollar than we can with your donation. We recommend
            that you consider donating to <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">a GiveWell charity</a> before donating to us. If you do not plan
            to donate to one of these highly effective charities instead, then we welcome your donation!</p>
