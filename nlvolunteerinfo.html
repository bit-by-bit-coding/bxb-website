<h1>Neural Logical Volunteer Information</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        The goal of this two week long summer program is to teach high-school students with a basic foundation in Python
        how to code a neural network in Keras. For more information on the specifics of Neural Logical please visit our
        Neural Logical page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Volunteer applications are now open, and we will be accepting volunteers through May 22nd.
    </p>
    <h3>General Outline</h3>
    <p>Students will be learning:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is machine learning (example projects, common uses, etc)?</li>
        <li>
            An overview of neural networks starting from a single layer and walking through adding neurons, the math
            (multiplying matrices), loss functions, updating, etc
        </li>
        <li>
            We offer two paths: one that teaches the more complex math and one that is more theoretical, thus it is
            not necessary that you understand every mathematical step in neural networks
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                However, we will be going in depth into backpropagation, activation/loss functions, gradient descent,
                etc
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            Creating a feedforward neural network for a simple project to gain an understanding of features and
            implementation
        </li>
        <li>
            Creating a convolutional neural network to identify tumors in MRI imaging data
        </li>
    </ul>

            <h3>Instructor/Helper Volunteers</h3>
            <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Possibly teach a large group of students the concepts of neural networks</li>
                <li>Otherwise, act as a supporting volunteer to answer students in the chat or break out with students
                </li>
                <li>
                    When broken out with students for one-on-one instruction, should be comfortable communicating
                    concepts to the students
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Time Commitment</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Around 3 hours a day the week of the program with extra time if you would like to stay after and
                    provide
                    students extra instruction
                </li>
                <li>An hour a week on volunteer training in the weeks leading up to the camp</li>
                <li>
                    An initial meeting with program director to determine your coding level provide extra training if
                    needed
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Have a solid understanding of Python and neural networks with Keras and Tensorflow</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If your knowledge on a few of the concepts is spotty, we will be more than happy to teach you!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also, if you are not familiar with Tensorflow or Keras but have worked with similar
                        libraries/frameworks,
                        it may take extra time to transition but should not be a barrier to volunteering
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you apply, you will receive a confirmation email letting you know that we have received your
                application. A follow up email will be sent out on April 28th and interviews will begin in May.</p>
