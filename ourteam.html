    <p>
        Bit by Bit Coding started with a problem, a bug in the programming community: a girl walked into the 
        engineering building at Lake Oswego High School, and she froze. She was the <em>only</em> girl. 
        <em>Again</em>. The same thing had happened to her last year. That meant one of two things: either, 
        she’d just experienced an event with less than a one-in-ten million chance of happening, <em>or</em> 
        there was a serious gender imbalance in STEM. Nobody else in the class seemed to notice anything. But 
        she saw it and felt it and got fed up with it until finally, she met a classmate with a similar story 
        who helped her do something about it. Midway through high school, in 2018, Sydney Von Arx and Selena 
        Zhang founded Bit by Bit Coding, a nonprofit dedicated to giving <em>everyone</em> the chance to code. 
        That summer, Bit by Bit ran its first iteration of its summer program, Hello World, that taught middle 
        school girls web development. The next year, Bit by Bit launched its year round program as clubs at the 
        middle and high schools.

    <p>
        In 2020, we had to move our programs online for the first time ever due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While 
        this came with a host of new challenges, it also brought new opportunities to reach students across 
        the globe. We expanded our vision to offer programs to hundreds of students and grew from simple web 
        development to more complex topics like machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also partnered with Stanford Effective Altruism to offer a seminar on critical thinking to high school 
        students. We wanted to empower them with the conscientiousness to discover the most pressing bugs in the 
        world around them and the agency to debug these problems and to create a better world, bit by bit.

          I have always enjoyed computers. After many years of coding, I joined
          Bit by Bit in 2019 as a volunteer. Since then, I have helped run all
          three of our coding programs (middle school, high school, and summer). I
          currently coordinate the Form and Function after-school coding program.
          I want to help people see the beauty behind the binary in coding.

          Learning about the world has been a passion of mine as I always wanted
          to understand the world around me. Coding has broadened my horizons
          bringing me many amazing opportunities such as volunteering with Bit by
          Bit, which I joined in the summer of 2020. Now, I coordinate our summer
          program, Hello World, to teach others about the wondrous world of
          coding.

          Hi! Compared to many people I know, I started coding pretty late due to
          an irrational fear of coding, but it has become one of my most
          intriguing hobbies. I joined Bit by Bit in 2020, working extensively to
          develop our Hello World summer camp. I currently direct BxB Central and
          hope to make it a strong community where students can learn, teach, and
          lead!

              <p>I’m Selena Zhang; I'm an avid web developer and love to teach and learn from others! Next year, I plan to
                  study computer science at MIT, but in eighth grade, I was the only girl in my computer science class,
                  and I felt discouraged and alienated. I want other girls to have a different experience, so I’ve devoted
                  hundreds of hours to teaching after-school programs throughout high school.

          Hello, I'm Bit by Bot, the official mascot of Form and Function and
          Hello World! I was created in the summer of 2020 by our volunteer and
          graphic design artist Olivia Wadley. I enjoy coding and learning new
          things about the world around me. In Bit by Bit, I get to experience
          the wonders of learning every day. To see more of me, you can visit
