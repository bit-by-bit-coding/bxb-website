        I'm Sydney Von Arx, a computer

      <strong>Devin Von Arx</strong>
      <p class="title">Form and Function Director</p>
      <p>
        I have always enjoyed computers. After many years of coding, I joined
        Bit by Bit in 2019 as a volunteer. Since then, I have helped run all
        three of our coding programs (middle school, high school, and summer). I
        currently coordinate the Form and Function after-school coding program.
        I want to help people see the beauty behind the binary in coding.

      <p class="title">Summer Programming Director</p>
      <p>
        Learning about the world has been a passion of mine as I always wanted
        to understand the world around me. Coding has broadened my horizons
        bringing me many amazing opportunities such as volunteering with Bit by
        Bit, which I joined in the summer of 2020. Now, I coordinate our summer
        program, Hello World, to teach others about the wondrous world of
        coding.

      <p class="title">Operations Director</p>
      <p>
        Hi! Compared to many people I know, I started coding pretty late due to
        an irrational fear of coding, but it has become one of my most
        intriguing hobbies. I joined Bit by Bit in 2020, working extensively to
        develop our Hello World summer camp. I currently direct BxB Central and
        hope to make it a strong community where students can learn, teach, and
        lead!

            <strong>Selena Zhang</strong>
            <p>I’m Selena Zhang; I'm an avid web developer and love to teach and learn from others! Next year, I plan to
                study computer science at MIT, but in eighth grade, I was the only girl in my computer science class,
                and I felt discouraged and alienated. I want other girls to have a different experience, so I’ve devoted
                hundreds of hours to teaching after-school programs throughout high school.

          Hello, I'm Bit by Bot, the official mascot of Form and Function and
          Hello World! I was created in the summer of 2020 by our volunteer and
          graphic design artist Olivia Wadley. I enjoy coding and learning new
          things about the world around me. In Bit by Bit, I get to experience
          the wonders of learning every day. To see more of me, you can visit
