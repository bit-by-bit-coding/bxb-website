    <p id="heading"> How my owners take care if me</p>
    </div>
    <div> My owners take very good care of me by...
        <br> Feeding me twice a day with one and a half a cup of food, taking me for a
        walk and give me lots of water.
        <div><br>
            <img src="http://www.albertsgoldenretrievers.com/Blaise_4.jpg" alt=" This dog is going for a walk">

            When my owners go out and about they put me in my crate so
            I don't be destructive or make a mess.
