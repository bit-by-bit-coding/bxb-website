        <h1>How Women's Soccer Became Popular in the USA</h1>
        <font color="white">
            <div>
                <p>The 1991 FIFA World Cup held in China was a start for women's soccer all over the world, but it was going
                    to take more than one WWC to make women's soccer as popular as men's. You'd think that, since the US
                    Women's National Team won the tournament that year, women's soccer in America would take a big leap,
                    but no. It took until 1999 for women's soccer in the USA to explode. The 1999 World Cup was hosted by
                    the United States. The final was in California. The USWNT was playing the Chinese National Team in the
                    World Cup final. After regulation and overtime ended, the score was still tied at 0-0. The game went
                    to penalty kicks. The USA took the last kick, with the score at 4-4. Brandi Chastain stepped up to take
                    the last kick. She knew that if she made it, her team would win. The referee blew her whistle. Chastain
                    ran at the ball, which was twelve yards away from the goal. She kicked. . . and scored! The USA had won
                    the 1999 World Cup!

            <div>
                <p>In 2000, shortly after the USWNT won the 1999 World Cup, the first American women's professional soccer league
                    was founded, called the Women's United Soccer Association, or WUSA. WUSA's inaugural season was in 2001.
                    The teams were:</p>
            </div>

            <li>Atlanta Beat</li>
            <li>Boston Breakers</li>
            <li>Carolina Courage</li>
            <li>New York Power</li>
            <li>Philadelphia Charge</li>
            <li>San Diego Spirit</li>
            <li>San Jose CyberRays</li>
            <li>Washington Freedom</li>

            <div>
                <p>In 2001, the San Jose CyberRays (Then known as the Bay Area CyberRays) beat the Atlanta Beat in the inagural
                    championship game in Foxboro, Massachussets, at the end of the regular season. However, the CyberRays
                    failed to defend their championship title. In WUSA's second season, the Carolina Courage defeated the
                    Washington Freedom in Atlanta, Georgia. But, like the CyberRays, the Courage couldn't win a second championship.
                    The Washington Freedom went from being runner-ups to champions in the league's third and final season
                    in 2003.The game took place in San Diego, California. The runner-up was, for the second time, the Atlanta
                    Beat. The Beat were provided with two chances in the WUSA championships, but unlike the Freedom, they
                    couldn't take advantage.</p>
                <p>Sadly, on September 15, 2003, WUSA folded. The fold was caused due to lack of popularity. were lower than
                    expectations. Also, WUSA had problems with money. Although some players offered to cut out major portions
                    of their salaries, it wasn't enough to save the league. However, WUSA had hopes to relaunch the organization,
                    holding two "WUSA festivals" in June of 2004. The festivals were located in Los Angeles, California,
                    and Blaine, Minnesota. Soccer games between former teams were. part of the festival. The festivals failed,
                    however, and WUSA just couldn't go on. Their days were over, but there was still hope.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The USA went without a women's professional soccer league for several years. . . until 2008. In 2006, plans
                    were made for another professional soccer league, called Women's Professional Soccer. The league planned
                    their first season in 2008, but their first champion, Sky Blue FC, was crowned in 2009. The teams the
                    league started with were:
                </p>
            </div>
            <li>Boston Breakers</li>
            <li>Chicago Red Stars</li>
            <li>FC Gold Pride</li>
            <li>Los Angeles Sol</li>
            <li>Sky Blue FC</li>
            <li>Saint Louis Athletica</li>
            <div>
                <p>During the first season, Sky Blue FC won the championship title. However, the Los Angeles Sol were the regular
                    season champions. In 2010, the league received two new additions, former WUSA team Atlanta Beat, and
                    the Philadelphia Independence. In the postseason, Sky Blue FC failed to defend their championship title,
                    giving up both the league and regular season championships up to FC Gold Pride. In 2011, the league got
                    the Western New York Flash, who won both league and regular season championships.

            <div>
                <p>In 2012, the WPS sadly announced their folding. They claimed that lack of resources, organization struggles,
                    and a legal battle were the causes of their closing. The league officially ceased operations in May of
                    2012.
