                An easy and fun activity is making home made popsicles.
                <br> You can do that by getting popsicle molds juice and/or mashed up fruit. Its easy and its delicious
                <img src="http://www.growingagreenfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Popsicle-Shoot-for-ice-pop-joy.jpg">
            </div>
             <div class="row">
            
                <br>
                <br> Another fun idea is making a sack race. This is a fun race and gets them moving. you can get them for not
                too much and use them over and over.<img src="http://utah.bouncinbins.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/a/sack-race.jpg"></div>
             
             <div class="row">
                    <br> Another fun idea to do with them is this kit that helps you make your own book. Its some thing you can do
                with everybody and its so fun </div>
                <div class="row"> <br> Another very fun idea is making a fort. You can do this with chairs cloth and anything else to hold the
                cloth up its fun and easy and should bring smiles to the kids faces. But of course you should ask their parents
                if its ok and also clean up the mess after.              <img src="https://meaningfulmama.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1-table-cloth-fort-table-.jpg"></div>
                <br> <div class="row"> If you are babysitting girls you could pull out a tea set and have a tea party. All you need is a tea set
                and tea.If you are doing a tea party with little girls you do not have to use tea.
                You can use milk or almond milk with vanilla and sugar. This is not the only recipe but it is delicious!<button>

                        </a>
                    </button></div>


                <br>
                <div class="row">  Another idea is playing fun games that everyone can participate. Some good games are suspend, mimic,and
                quick cups. All of these games are games that everyone can play. But any game is good.  <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91JxmavGQYL._SX355_.jpg">
            </div>
                <p>/p>
                        <div class="row">       Another idea for girls is taking any left over beads and string and you can make bracelets. And if you do not have and beads
                you can get some for super cheap.</div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br> Another idea is playing restaurant. You can do this a million ways. One way is getting cardboard and cutting
                it into food. Then color it and get the play menus, (or paper) its fun, its easy,and its crafty.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br> Get ready to pull out a chair as the curtains open for a puppet show!!! This is a fun thing all you need
                is cardboard and puppets.
                <br>
                <br><div class="row">  Don't worry if you do not have puppets cause you can make sock puppets. All you need is a sock,googly eyes,glue,
                and the thing that you make the mouth with optional. Another fun and crafty thing is making a puzzle. Its
                inexpensive and it is very fun.</div>

                    <br>
                    <br> This part of the website is show you tips that can make sure the parents want you to come back.
                    <br>
                    <br> One thing is make sure to not leave anything out.
                    <br>
                    <br> After making popsicles or after lunch make sure to put away the mess.
                    <br>
                    <br> Another thing that will wow the parents is by doing the extra things.
                    <br>
                    <br> One of them is doing there laundry after the kids are asleep.They will want you back!
                    <br>
                    <br> Make sure the kids are having fun.
                    <br>
                    <br> Remember the kids will report everything that you do.
                    <br>
                    <br> Another thing is to make sure the kids do not watch tv.
                    <br>
                    <br> Unless the parents let them of course.
                    <br>
                    <br> But one thing I know is that parents will not want to pay you to the the kids watch tv.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br> One of my last tips are questions you should ask before the parents go.
                    <br>
                    <br> 1 One thing that you should definitely ask is that if there are any allergies.
                    <br>
                    <br> 2 Ask what they can have for a snack.
                    <br>
                    <br> I know that that sounds like a silly question but you don't want to give them a treat that they aren't
                    allowed to have.
                    <br>
                    <br> Another really good question to ask is what to do if they are bad.
                    <br>
                    <br> This sounds like a mean question but you don't want them to act up.
                    <br>
                    <br> 3 And lastly have fun with them!!!!
