    <h2> Website by: M.R., August 10th, 2018 </h2>
    Help Clean the Oceans! We need to help keep the oceans and the wildlife in it! It is
    <strong>extremely</strong> unhealthy. Right now, there is a large amount of plastic invading our waters! If we keep this up,
    our ocean view will be full of trash and plastic. People need to
    <strong> recycle </strong> plastic. That's right. Almost every piece of plastic can be recycled. More importantly, it should be.
    Be respectful at the beach. Make sure trash doesn't blow away. When you are at a river, don't throw your trash into it.
    Make sure you aren't putting trash into a lake, river, pond, ocean, and any other body of water that is important to
    our world. Animals die because of trash in the ocean. They get tangeled in the plastic and can get injured as well. Be
    aware of wildlife. You wouldn't want someone putting tons and tons of trash into your habitat. 13 million metric tons
    of plastic is polluting the oceans.Over 100 million marine animals die from plastic in the ocean each year.Take a look
    at the photos below. Imagine all that trash was at a beach you visited. It's awful that people will litter. Lets get
    on to the garbage. There are two garbage patches. The Western Garbage Patch, and The Eastern Garbage Patch. The Western
    Garbage Patch spans from the waters of the West Coast in North America, to Japan. The Eastern Garbage Patch is located
    between the waters of Hawaii, all the way to California. It's a huge problem that's spread in our oceans. We should recycle
    and be respectful of our surroundings. There are websites you can go to that spread awareness such as this one. Plasticoceans.org
    is a website where you can donate. If one of your favorite animals is a marine animal, think about what might happen
    to them. The plastic spreading through our oceans affects
    <strong> all wildlife </strong> and our
    <strong> entire planet!</strong> Animals will die. The planet will be unhealthy. Don't forget about Global Warming. Some people
    say that Global Warming is not real. Well, hate to break it to you Trump, it is. The air will get dirty. Tempuratures
    will raise. Glaciers are melting. Animals are dying. And don't forget about the algae blooms. There was one in Florida
    in the summer of 2018. Dead animals washed up on shore because of Global Warming causing the very affective algae bloom.
