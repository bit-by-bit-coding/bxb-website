<h1>BxB Central Standard Volunteer Information</h1>
<div>
    <h2>BxB Central</h2>
    <p>
        The commitment levels for this team are fairly flexible, but the average time commitment is anywhere from 1 to 5 hours a week depending on your commitment level. Within the central organization, there are several smaller teams: website, marketing, fundraising, and software engineer. Keep in mind that we may create new teams if we have other avenues we want to pursue such as new projects or programs!

    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in and are accepted to this team, it may be a little more time commitment in the beginning to get you all set up. This would involve additional meetings with the Director of Operations or the lead for your respective team!
