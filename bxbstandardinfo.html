<h1>BxB Central Standard Volunteer Information</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Bit by Bit Central</h2>
    <p>
        The commitment levels for this team are fairly flexible, but the average time commitment is anywhere
        from 1 to 3 hours a week depending on how invested you are. Within the central organization,
        there are several smaller teams: Marketing, Website Design, Fundraising and Software Engineer.
        However, keep in mind that we may create new teams if we have other avenues we want to pursue
        such as new projects or programs!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in and are accepted to this team, it may be a little more time commitment
        in the beginning to get you all set up. This would involve meetings with the Central Organization Coordinator
        and meetings with the Team Lead!
