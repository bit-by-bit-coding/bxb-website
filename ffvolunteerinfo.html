<h1>Form and Function Volunteer Information</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Form and Function Team</h2>
    <p>The goal is to teach middle schoolers how to code an interactive website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through an
        after school program that will meet three times a week. Volunteer commitment has flexibility dependent on which
        volunteer position you sign up for and which days you are available. The options are standard volunteer, homeroom instructor, and curriculum.
    </p>
    <h3>General Outline</h3>
    <p>The afterschool program will be divided into homerooms. Each homeroom will focus on a different stage in learning
        web design. Students will follow an established pathway through the homerooms.
    </p>
