<h2>// Covid-19 Policy</h2>
<p>
    Due to Covid-19, we are not certain whether or not our program will be in-person or online. If we have to move
    the program online, we will not be able to provide laptops, but we will provide around 2 hours of fun, interactive
    instruction on the same dates! Any payment accepted at that time will be fully refunded minus a credit card
    processing fee. We’ll keep you posted on developments.

    and we’ll hold a spot for your child until the payment deadline and notify you of any updates.

<ul>
    <li> <strong>Social Distancing: </strong> If the camp is in-person, we may limit the number of participants to
        ensure fewer than 25
        people are gathered in any space and that we can maintain 6 feet of distance between them.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Food: </strong> We will likely switch to providing only pre-packaged food or will take other precautions
        to minimize the
        number of people in contact with the food, such as by having a designated volunteer wearing adequate protection
        dispense any snacks.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Check-In: </strong> Campers will likely need to go through additional screening, such as temperature
        checks or other
        Covid-19 related tests.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Additional Precautions:</strong> All campers must wear face-coverings.
    </li>
