<h2>Covid-19 Policy</h2>
<p>
    Due to Covid-19, we are not certain whether or not our program will be in-person or online. If we have to move
    the program online, we will not be able to provide laptops, but we will provide around 2 hours of fun, interactive
    instruction on the same dates! Any payment accepted at that time will be fully refunded minus a credit card
    processing fee. We’ll keep you posted on developments.
</p>
<p>
    Register soon to reserve your spot! Sign up <a href="{{ 'programs.html' | relative_url | remove: '.html' }}">here</a> and we’ll notify you of any updates.

<ul>
    <li> <strong>Social Distancing: </strong> If the camp is in-person, we may limit the number of participants to ensure that we are within state and local limits and can maintain 6 feet
    of distance between campers.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Food: </strong> We will likely switch to providing only pre-packaged food or will take other precautions
        to minimize the
        number of people in contact with the food, such as by having a designated volunteer wearing adequate protection
        dispense any snacks.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Check-In: </strong> Campers will likely need to go through additional screening, such as temperature
        checks and/or other
        Covid-19 related tests.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Additional Precautions:</strong> All campers must wear face-coverings.
    </li> 
</ul>
