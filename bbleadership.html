<h1>BxB Leadership Information</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Bit by Bit is looking for the next generation of leaders to help run BxB Central, the behind-the-scenes branch of our organization! We are seeking dedicated 
    individuals who are interested in spreading our mission of diversifying the next generation of thinkers, leaders, and coders. Over the school year and summer, 
    we have run a total of five programs which we encourage you to read about through our website. However, these programs could not run without the support of the 
    teams in BxB Central: software, website, marketing, and fundraising teams. A large part of our mission is providing leadership opportunities, and these two positions 
    provide unique opportunities to guide a team of over 35 volunteers. Please do not be intimidated if you have not held a major leadership position before. We especially 
    welcome high school and college students to apply.

    <h3>Director of Operations:</h3>
    <p>
        The Director of Operations carries a large amount of responsibility over BxB Central through deciding on new projects and carrying through such pursuits. While the Assistant Director of Operations will focus on immediate logistics and planning, the Director of Operations will focus more on long-term vision and planning, communicating with external stakeholders, and relaying information to other branches of the organization. Such a position requires strong problem-solving, communication, and creative thinking skills. They will be responsible for maintaining stability within the branch in respect to the rest of the organization and ensure that the teams are doing what is necessary to support the programs. 

    </p>
    <p>
        The Director of Operations will serve as a bridge between BxB Central and the other branches of the organization 
        as well as between BxB Central and outside sources. They will plan goals for the organization and relay such goals with the necessary leadership, correspond with sponsors and partners, and lead (along with the Assistant Director) leadership and organization-wide meetings. This includes working with other leadership members to conduct interviews, onboardings, and create a collaborative environment. 

    </p>
    <p>
        As such an important bridge in the organization, the Director of Operations will attend director meetings and interact with the marketing, website, software engineer, fundraising, and HR teams. They will work especially closely with the Assistant Director of Operations. Upon successful completion in August, they will receive a bonus of $2,000.

    </p>
    <p>
        However, please keep in mind that although it may seem like the amount of work for such a position can be overwhelming, much of what is required from the leadership position is the ability to delegate tasks. The BxB Central Director does not need to be the sole medium of communication, run all the meetings, or conduct all of the interviews -- many of these tasks can be given to other leadership members through collaboration and teamwork. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Coding, marketing, or fundraising experience is not required. The key to leadership is not being the best at everything; instead, it is about being able to recognize others’ skill and talents and utilize them in an effective manner.

        the time commitment may be greater. This position is a year long commitment, running through the end of the 2021/2022 school year.

        not everyone will have previous work experience and we do not want that to stop anyone from applying. The reference can be a teacher, mentor, or anybody else who you believe 
        will be able to speak to your abilities as a team player and leader along with providing insight into your organizational skills and work ethic.</p>

    <p>
        The Assistant Director of Operations will also carry a large amount of responsibility over the behind-the-scenes operations of BxB Central. 
        While the Director of Operations will focus on long-term vision and planning, the Assistant Director of Operations will focus more on day-to-day

        The Assistant Director of Operations will play an integral role as the bridge between the different teams in the branch and higher leadership. While they can play a role in long-term planning and organization-wide goals if they would like, their main purpose will be to make sure such goals can be accomplished within BxB Central. This involves planning the best ways to achieve objectives through the marketing, fundraising, software engineer, and website teams; correspondence with program directors and the BxB Central Director; and ensuring smooth day-to-day operations within the branch of the organization. Along with the BxB Central Director, the Assistant Director of Operations will lead leadership and organization-wide meetings, including working with other leadership meetings to conduct interviews, onboardings, and creating a collaborative environment.
