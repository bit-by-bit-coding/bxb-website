                    Hello, I'm Bit By Bot, the official mascot of Bit by Bit! I was created in the summer of 2020 by our
                    volunteer and graphic design artist Olivia Wadley. I enjoy coding and learning new things about the
                    world around me. In Bit By Bit, I get to experience the wonders of learning every day. To see more of
                    me, you can visit the <a href="{{ 'formfunction.html' | relative_url | remove: '.html' }}">Form and 
                    Function</a> or <a href="{{ 'helloworld.html' | relative_url | remove: '.html' }}">Hello World</a> information pages!
