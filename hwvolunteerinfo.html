<h1>Hello World Volunteer Information</h1>
<div>
    <p>The goal of our summer program is to teach middle school girls and non-binary youth how to code an interactive 
        website in HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript through a 1 to 2 week-long summer camp. For more information on the specifics of Hello World,
        please visit our <a href="{{ 'helloworld.html' | relative_url | remove: '.html' }}">Hello World page</a>.</p>
    <p>Volunteer applications are now <strong>closed</strong>.</p>
    <h3>General Outline</h3>
    <p>The camp will have two tracks that teach at different speeds: a normal track and a faster track that is meant for
        students that have previous coding experience. Volunteers may teach workshops focused on a particular coding
        concept or work one-on-one with students.
    </p>
    <p id="no-below">We understand that your commitment may vary, and as we approach the camp, we will be deciding on
        volunteers that
        will act as an instructor or standard volunteer based on preference and performance.</p>
