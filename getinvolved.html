            <p><strong>What:</strong> Hello World, a summer camp that teaches middle school girls the basics of web
                development.</p>

            <p><strong>Who:</strong> You! We’re looking for volunteers who know (or are willing to learn) the basics of
                HTML,
                CSS, and Javascript. <strong>Programming experience is appreciated but NOT required -- we provide free
                    training!</strong></p>

            <p><strong>When:</strong> 2:00-4:00pm PST on Aug. 3-7 and Aug. 10-14. <strong>You don’t have to come every day;
                    just days
                    that work for you!</strong> Expect to do at least one hour of volunteer training beforehand, or more
                if you
                don’t know how to code.</p>

            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Gain up to 25+ volunteer hours (or choose to do less), join a community of
                programmers, and empower girls to
                code. We’ll teach you invaluable coding and leadership skills for free, and you can gain loads of
                volunteer
                hours or a
                position on your resume while you’re at it.

            <h2>Donate</h2>
            <p>Our programs are free, but your donations are what keep Bit by Bit low-cost and high-quality! We recommend a donation of $35 for every week of programming you sign up for.</p>
            <p>We appreciate donations -- they make Bit by Bit possible. Before you donate to us, however, please recognize there are other charities that save more lives per dollar than we can with your donation. We recommend donating to <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">a GiveWell charity</a> rather than to us. If you do not plan to donate to one of these highly effective charities instead, then we welcome your donation!</p>
