        <h2>Volunteer</h2>

        <p><strong>What:</strong> Hello World, a summer camp that teaches middle school girls the basics of web
            development.</p>

        <p><strong>Who:</strong> You! We’re looking for volunteers who know (or are willing to learn) the basics of
            HTML,
            CSS, and Javascript. <strong>Programming experience is appreciated but NOT required -- we provide free
                training!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>When:</strong> 2:00-4:00pm PST on Aug. 3-7 and Aug. 10-14. <strong>You don’t have to come every day;
                just days
                that work for you!</strong> Expect to do at least one hour of volunteer training beforehand, or more
            if you
            don’t know how to code.</p>

        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Gain up to 25+ volunteer hours (or choose to do less), join a community of
            programmers, and empower girls to
            code. We’ll teach you invaluable coding and leadership skills for free, and you can gain loads of
            volunteer
            hours or a
            position on your resume while you’re at it.

        <p>Your donations are what keep Bit by Bit low-cost and high-quality! We recommend a donation of $35 for every
            week of programming you sign up for.</p>
        <p>We appreciate donations -- they make Bit by Bit possible. Before you donate to us, however, please recognize
            there are other charities that save more lives per dollar than we can with your donation. We recommend
            donating to <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">a GiveWell charity</a> rather than to us. If you do not plan
            to donate to one of these highly effective charities instead, then we welcome your donation!</p>
