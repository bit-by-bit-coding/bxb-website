      <strong>Christian Smith</strong>
      <p class="title">Uncommon Sense Instructor</p>
      <p>
      For as long as I can remember, making sense of the strange world around me has been my central endeavor.  
      I have learned that being able to tell accurate information from inaccurate information is key to succeeding in any goal in life.  
      What excites me about working with Uncommon Sense is having the opportunity to help students 
      build a foundation from which they can make sense of the world around them, and therefore, be well-equipped 
      to succeed in their own endeavors. I recently graduated from Stanford with a BS in Education.

        Our leadership plays a crucial role in running smaller sections within BxB Central. They are the brains behind many of our
        organization's operations, training new volunteers, organizing their teams, and constantly improving
        what they do.
