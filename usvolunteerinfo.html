<h1>Uncommon Sense Volunteer Information</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Uncommon Sense Team</h2>
    <p>
        Uncommon Sense seeks to teach tools and techniques to ponder, question, probe, and develop decisions,
        beliefs, and actions. By default, your brain will decide whether or not a statement is true by looking
        at things like “how symmetrical is the face of the person telling me this?” “what accent does the person
        speaking have?” or “how many times have I heard this statement before?” We provide students with the
        community and toolkit (full of cognitive science, probability theory, decision theory, and more) necessary
        to try making their decisions more consciously and updating their beliefs based on the strength of the
        evidence presented.
    </p>
    <p>Volunteers should be ready to learn and practice the concepts we’ll teach. You should be skeptical, intrinsically
        motivated to seek out the truth, and eager to learn when you’re wrong.
    </p>

    <h3>General Outline</h3>
    <p>
        The program runs from 4-5pm PT Wednesdays. Every four weeks will focus on exploring a different concept,
        with the final of the four weeks in a unit focused on implementing the idea and synthesising concepts.
        Volunteers should arrive at 3:30 and stay until 5:15. There will also be other meetings to plan
        and rehearse for roughly an hour a week (exact times and durations may change).
    </p>

    <h3>Teaching Volunteer</h3>
    <p>About 2 hours a week. Dive into specific activities, ideas, and games, mastering them well enough to teach.
        Engage with students ideas and inquiries.
    </p>

    <h3>Curriculum Volunteer</h3>
    <p>About 4 hours a week. Along with teaching, brainstorm, test, and refine activities for the program.
