        <h2>Form and Function</h2>
        <p><strong>What: </strong>
            Form and Function is a free weekly after school program dedicated to making real code accessible to middle
            schoolers.
            Each week the students will do projects, get one-on-one help,
            and interact with demos as they gain an understanding of programming and web design.
            Participants will code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create their very own websites.
            Previous coding experience is welcomed but by no means necessary.
            No matter your starting ability, we will find the right challenge.
            Attend regularly and progress through our levels or drop in any week.
            To learn more about what those levels look like, check out our <strong><a
                    href="{{ 'homerooms.html' | relative_url | remove: '.html' }}">homeroom levels guide</a></strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="no-below"><strong>Who: </strong>Any middle schooler who has ever wondered how a website is made. Any
            middle schooler
            who has ever wanted to create something for the internet. Any middle schooler who is curious about coding.
            In short, everyone!
        </p>
        <p><strong>Important Note:
                Check back in July when registration opens for the next school year!

        <h3>FAQs</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>Are there any additional costs or fees?</summary>
            <p>
                No! We believe everyone should be able to learn to code without worrying about the cost.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Can I join part-way through the year?</summary>
            <p>
                Definitely! Our program is designed to have ongoing enrollment. Join us any time of the year.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you need previous coding experience?</summary>
            <p>
                No! We welcome everyone from those who have never coded before to those who are already advanced
                coders.
                Form and Function has projects for every ability. Our goal is for students to have fun while
                working on
                projects and lessons individually tailored to their level.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What if my child is in 5th grade but really wants to attend?</summary>
            <p>We love children who have a passion for coding! However, our program is designed for a particular
                age
                range. To discuss your individual situation, please email <a
                    href="mailto:{{site.contact.email}}">{{site.contact.email}}</a>.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What type of computer will my child need and do they need to download any software?
            </summary>
            <p>
                Any type of computer is fine, though ideally not a Chromebook. Sometimes, parental controls do
                not allow
                for students to code using the tools that they need access to. To check if you have this
                problem,
                right-click on any webpage and select “Inspect.” If nothing opens, the parental controls on the
                computer
                may be too tight. (This is done to prevent kids from hacking into things, but it also prevents
                them from
                using the developer’s console, which is essential to their ability to code properly.) Also, we
                prefer if
                you do not use a tablet, but tablets will suffice if they are the last resort. On their first
                day of the
                program, they will create a free CodeSandbox account that does not require downloading any
                software. The
                login, however, requires that your child has either a Google or GitHub account.

        <details>
            <summary>What online platform will the camp use? Are the meetings recorded?</summary>
            <p>Form and Function will meet in a password-protected Zoom classroom. We do not record the Zoom
                meetings as
                we value you and your child’s safety and privacy.

                Is there a difference between the Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday class?
            </summary>
            <p>
                No! We offer the same program on three different days.

                Form & Function was amazing!! I loved to code with great helpers and teachers! Every week, coming back,
                it felt like there was something BIG, something NEW to learn. :)

                I really like your coding program throughout the year. It really helped my coding skills and I learned
                the basic of 3 whole coding languages! In only the last 9 months!! The teachers are just fantastic and
                have a great sense of humor, as well as the ability to make the class interesting and let everyone
                participate.

                I think form and function is great. The teachers are fun and I felt like I could ask them anything. I
                went to other coding classes too, but this is the best one by a mile. All the teachers aren't just great
                - they're really smart.
                I learned a lot from this and I enjoyed coming here. I hope there is going to be form and function next
                year too! I would definitely come.

                This program was amazing! It taught me many basic coding skills that I would not have learned, and the
                volunteers were amazing too. They dedicated so much time to make sure I understand what was taught and
                that I had no problems. They also helped me with my own projects too!
