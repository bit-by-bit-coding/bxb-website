        <h2>Form and Function</h2>
        <p><strong>What: </strong>
            Form and Function is a free weekly after school program dedicated to making real code accessible to middle
            schoolers.
            Each week the students will do projects, get one-on-one help,
            and interact with demos as they gain an understanding of programming and web design.
            Participants will code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create their very own websites.
            Previous coding experience is welcomed but by no means necessary.
            No matter your starting ability, we will find the right challenge.
            Attend regularly and progress through our levels or drop in any week. </p>
        <p><strong>Who: </strong>Any middle schooler who has ever wondered how a website is made. Any middle schooler
            who has ever wanted to create something for the internet. Any middle schooler who is curious about coding.
            In short, everyone!
