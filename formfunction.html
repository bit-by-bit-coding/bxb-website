                Form and Function is a free, online, weekly after-school program for curious middle school students who want to learn to code their very own websites! Participants will learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- <b>no previous coding experience necessary.</b>

                        Students will attend class weekly and progress through our multiple homeroom levels. Each homeroom in the program takes 4 weeks to complete, and students who complete all homerooms will have the ability to create websites and online games. <br><br>

                        New students are welcome to sign up at anytime, but they will begin class at the start of each new 4-week cycle. For example, if a participant signs up on January 3rd and the next 4-week cycle begins on January 15th, the participant will be told to join on the 15th. <br><br>

                        Previous coding experience is welcome but by no means necessary. No matter your starting ability, we will find the right challenge for you!

        <details>
            <summary>Are there any additional costs or fees?</summary>
            <p>
                We believe everyone should be able to learn to code without worrying about the cost. However, we would appreciate donations. Anything helps, even just $5!
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Can I join part-way through the year?</summary>
            <p>
                Definitely! Our program is designed to have ongoing enrollment, but we will send the zoom link to join once the next cycle starts.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you need previous coding experience?</summary>
            <p>
                No! We welcome everyone from those who have never coded before to those who are already advanced
                coders.
                Form and Function has projects for every ability. Our goal is for students to have fun while
                working on
                projects and lessons individually tailored to their level.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What if my child is in 5th grade but really wants to attend?</summary>
            <p>We love children who have a passion for coding! However, our program is designed for a particular
                age
                range. To discuss your individual situation, please email <a
                    href="mailto:{{site.contact.email}}">{{site.contact.email}}</a>.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What type of computer will my child need and do they need to download any software?
            </summary>
            <p>
                Any type of computer is fine, though ideally not a Chromebook. Sometimes, parental controls do
                not allow
                for students to code using the tools that they need access to. To check if you have this
                problem,
                right-click on any webpage and select “Inspect.” If nothing opens, the parental controls on the
                computer
                may be too tight. (This is done to prevent kids from hacking into things, but it also prevents
                them from
                using the developer’s console, which is essential to their ability to code properly.) Also, we
                prefer if
                you do not use a tablet, but tablets will suffice if they are the last resort. On their first
                day of the
                program, they will create a free CodeSandbox account that does not require downloading any
                software. The
                login, however, requires that your child has either a Google or GitHub account.

        <details>
            <summary>What online platform will the camp use? Are the meetings recorded?</summary>
            <p>Form and Function will meet in a password-protected Zoom classroom. We do not record the Zoom
                meetings as
                we value you and your child’s safety and privacy.

            <summary>
                Is there a difference between the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday class?
            </summary>
            <p>
                No! We offer the same program on three different days.

                I think form and function is great. The teachers are fun and I felt like I could ask them anything. I
                went to other coding classes too, but this is the best one by a mile. All the teachers aren't just great
                - they're really smart.
                I learned a lot from this and I enjoyed coming here. I hope there is going to be form and function next
                year too! I would definitely come.
