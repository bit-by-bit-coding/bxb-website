        <h2>Form and Function</h2>
        <p><strong>What: </strong>
            Form and Function is a free weekly after school program dedicated to making real code accessible to middle
            schoolers.
            Each week the students will do projects, get one-on-one help,
            and interact with demos as they gain an understanding of programming and web design.
            Participants will code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create their very own websites.
            Previous coding experience is welcomed but by no means necessary.
            No matter your starting ability, we will find the right challenge.
            Attend regularly and progress through our levels or drop in any week. 
            To learn more about what those levels look like, check out our <a href="{{ 'homerooms.html' | relative_url | remove: '.html' }}">homeroom levels guide</a>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Who: </strong>Any middle schooler who has ever wondered how a website is made. Any middle schooler
            who has ever wanted to create something for the internet. Any middle schooler who is curious about coding.
            In short, everyone!

        <h3>FAQs</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>Are there any additional costs or fees?</summary>
            <p>
                No! We believe everyone should be able to learn to code without worrying about the cost.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Can I join part-way through the year?</summary>
            <p>
                Definitely! We have ongoing enrollment. 
                Join us at any time.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you need previous coding experience?</summary>
            <p>
                No! We welcome everyone from those who have never coded before to those who are advanced. 
                Form and Function has projects for every ability. 
                Our goal is for students to have fun while working on code tailored to their level.

            <summary>What if my child is in 5th grade but really wants to attend?</summary>
            <p>We love children who have a passion for coding! However, our program is designed for a particular age range. To discuss your individual situation, please email <a href="mailto:{{site.contact.email}}">{{site.contact.email}}</a>.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What type of computer will my child need?</summary>
            <p>
                Any type of computer is fine, though ideally not a Chromebook. Sometimes, parental controls do not allow for students to code using the tools that they need access to. To check if you have this problem, right-click on any webpage and select “Inspect.” If nothing opens, the parental controls on the computer may be too tight. (This is done to prevent kids from hacking into things, but it also prevents them from using the developer’s console, which is essential to their ability to code properly) Also, we prefer if you do not use a tablet, but tablets will suffice if they are the last resort.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Does my child need to download any software?</summary>
            <p>
                No. On their first day of the program, they will create a free <a href="https://codesandbox.io/">CodeSandbox</a> 
                account that does not require downloading any software. The login, however, requires that your child has either a Google or GitHub account.

        <details>
            <summary>What online platform will the camp use?</summary>
            <p>Form and Function will operate on a password-protected Zoom classroom.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Are the zoom meetings recorded?</summary>
            <p>No. If there is ever a reason to record a session, we will ask for permission.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How long has Form and Function been in operation?</summary>
            <p>
                We have been teaching middle-school coding programs since 2018. Due to the current circumstances, this year is the first time that Form and Function is online, allowing us to offer our program to anyone from anywhere!
