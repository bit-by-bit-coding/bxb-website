    <h1>Neural Logical</h1>
    <p class="no-below"><strong>What: </strong>Neural Logical is a two-week summer camp that teaches highschoolers the
        intricacies of neural networks in the Keras framework. From playing with a neural network to learning
        the concepts and math behind it, students will learn everything they need to know to code their own
        neural networks to analyze feature sets, numerical data, and images! By the end of the program, students
        will have built a feedforward neural net to predict housing prices and a convolutional neural network to
        identify tumors in MRI imaging data.</p>
