            <p><strong>What: </strong>Neural Logical is a two-week summer camp that teaches highschoolers the
                intricacies of neural networks in the Keras framework. From playing with a neural network to learning
                the concepts and math behind it, students will learn everything they need to know to code their own
                neural networks to analyze feature sets, numerical data, and images! By the end of the program, students
                will have built a feedforward neural net to predict housing prices and a convolutional neural network to
                identify tumors in MRI imaging data.</p>
            <p><strong>Who: </strong>Any high school student who knows the foundations of Python. No experience in
                neural networks necessary!</p>
            <p><strong>Where: </strong>Online. Join us from anywhere!</p>
            <p><strong>Cost: </strong>
                Completely free for anyone who wishes to sign up!
