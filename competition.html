    <h1>2021 Wondrous Websites: Innovations</h1>
    <p>
        The Wondrous Websites competition is an opportunity offered by the nonprofit Bit by Bit to help further
        cultivate students' interests in the world of coding. Bit by Bit offers free programs such as Hello World, 
        Form and Function, Uncommon Sense, and Neural Logical that teach and diversify the community of creators 
        by providing the next generation with the tools of technology, thinking, and leadership to improve the 
        world bit by bit. Now, we are giving students all over the world the opportunity to showcase their computer 
        science skills!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Rising sixth through ninth graders</strong> will be eligible to participate in the competition to submit their own 
        website and compete for an exciting variety of prizes! Students will create their websites around their 
        interpretation of this year’s theme: innovations. The theme is intentionally broad. For example, you can build a 
        website about a historical invention with details such as who created it, when it was created, etc. You 
        can create a website about any invention that you would like to make (no matter how serious or silly) 
        with information on why you think it’s important and how you might go about building it. Or, you can code 
        a website about any other topic that is related to innovation.
