    <h1>2021 Wondrous Websites: Innovations</h1>
    <p>
        The Wondrous Websites competition is an opportunity offered by the nonprofit Bit by Bit to help further
        cultivate students' interests in the world of coding. Bit by Bit offers free programs such as Hello World, 
        Form and Function, Uncommon Sense, and Neural Logical that teach and diversify the community of creators 
        by providing the next generation with the tools of technology, thinking, and leadership to improve the 
        world bit by bit. Now, we are giving students all over the world the opportunity to showcase their computer 
        science skills!

        Rising sixth through ninth graders will be eligible to participate in the competition to submit their own 
        website and compete for an exciting variety of prizes! Students will create their websites around their 
        interpretation of this year’s theme: innovations. The theme is intentionally broad. You can build a 
        website about a historical invention with details such as who created it, when it was created, etc. You 
        can create a website about any invention that you would like to make (no matter how serious or silly) 
        with information on why you think it’s important and how you might go about building it. Or, you can code 
        a website about any other topic that is related to innovation.

        While students do have free range over the variety of content they would like to include, they will be 
        judged in the following categories: content, design, usability, creativity, and coding practices. A 
        rubric will be available to participants on August 10th.
    </p>
    <p>
        Students can win 1st place in the four distinct categories or 1st and 2nd place as Wondrous Website 
        Winner. The Wondrous Website Winners will receive a personalized plaque, an awards certificate, and a 
        large variety of Bit by Bit merch! The category winners will also receive an awards certificate and 
        merch! All winners will be featured on our website along with their projects!

        Registration for the competition will be open from August 10th to October 1st, 2021. Submission will open September 1st and close October 15th, 2021, where students will submit their final website. There is a registration fee of $7 that will be used to keep our programs free and accessible while 
        improving student reach, technology, and overall quality. You can pay this fee when filling out the 
        registration form.
