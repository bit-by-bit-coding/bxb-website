    <h3>Team Co-Lead Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
        Although leading a team is often a complex and difficult process, there are a few key responsibilities that we focus on. Team co-leads have a large say in the direction of their team, so their largest responsibility is setting long-term goals and organizing members so they can achieve those goals. From there, the goals should be broken down into understandable tasks that are delegated to each team member to carry out effectively. Team co-leads should also be checking in with members on progress updates and communicating with other leadership constantly. Time commitment, although flexible, is usually around 6-8 hours a week.

    </p>
    <p>
        Other responsibilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recruit and train new members for each team</li>
        <li>Keep team organized and directed towards a set goal</li>
        <li>Manage meetings and administrative work</li>
        <li>Attend weekly leadership meetings to give updates and discuss how things can be improved</li>
        <li>
            Have weekly meetings to update the team on progress, and make announcements, assign tasks, and
            discuss future goals
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>General Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
        We understand that many applicants may not have had previous experience in something as specific as being a software engineer in an organization. However, we do require previous leadership experience, whether that be within your school club or your local church group. It does not have to be extremely formal or rigorous, but we want to know that you have the ability to organize and communicate with others, delegate tasks, and work towards a larger goal.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will be asking for a reference on the application, but this reference does not need to be too formal. We understand with current circumstances and also by nature of age, not everyone will have previous work experience and we do not  want that to stop anyone from applying. The reference can be a teacher, mentor, or anybody else who you believe will be able to speak to your abilities as a team player and leader along with providing insight into your organizational skills and work ethic.

    </p>
    <p>
        As an organization, we want to help you grow by giving you the tools needed to learn more about skills ranging from leadership to website design. Thus, we want to make sure you believe that the co-lead position is one that you will be dedicated to and also enjoy. If you are not sure of your commitment in co-leading our website team, we would love for you to apply for a standard position in the team or any other team you may be interested in!

    <h2>Marketing Team Co-Lead</h2>
    <p>
        We are looking for someone who has the drive, determination, commitment, and organizational skills to co-lead our marketing team, expand our services, further our mission, and build connections. 

    </p>
    <p>
        The marketing team is the brains behind outreach, collaborations, social media, and more! Like all the other teams in BxB Central, the team is small, but also extremely effective. There are currently around 6 team members, but that number fluctuates depending on where volunteers are needed most urgently. There are countless marketing tactics that Bit by Bit can explore as long as we have someone who is willing to put the time and effort into researching and pursuing those avenues. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The marketing team is largely organized into two sub-teams: social media and outreach. Social media covers all things content research, graphic design, and platform management related while outreach covers connecting with outside organizations and communities, forging partnerships, and creating contact lists. The co-leads’ specific responsibilities largely depend on which sub-team they run, but they will help support the other team if needed. Thus, if you find that you are more drawn to a specific sub-team, we encourage you to mention that on the application. 

    </p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Specific Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>
            You should also be familiar with social media and general outreach techniques. Again, we do expect for you to have an abundance of previous knowledge on the inner workings of marketing. However, you should be willing to put in the extra time and work to research marketing tactics and determine which ones are the best fit for our organization.

    <h2>Fundraising Team Lead</h2>
    <p>
        We are looking for someone who has the drive, determination, commitment, and organizational skills to our fundraising to further our mission. The team manages donors, sponsorships, fundraisers, and grants. Like all the other teams in BxB Central, the team is small, but also extremely effective. There are currently around 2  team members, but that number fluctuates depending on where volunteers are needed most urgently.

    <div>
        <h3>Specific Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>
            While we prefer applicants who have previous fundraising experience, it is not required to apply for this position. However, much of fundraising is the ability to communicate with others, whether it be donors or sponsors. Much of this communication is written through sponsorship letters or grant applications. As the fundraising team lead, we would like to see a strong ability to write concisely and persuasively along with effective communication skills. We understand that you may not be familiar with writing grants or sponsorship letters, but as long as you have a strong foundation in writing, learning how to do so should not be too difficult.
