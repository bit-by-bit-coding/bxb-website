<h1>Apply to our leadership team!</h1>
<p>
    Our leadership team is now accepting applications! Bit by Bit is a student-run organization, and we 
    want to give other students the project management experience that they may struggle to find elsewhere. 
    We especially welcome high-schoolers to apply ⁠— we know that many of you may be worried you do not have 
    the experience to qualify, but that is why a large part of Bit by Bit is giving teenagers the opportunity 
    to develop their leadership skills. However, if you do not think that you are willing to make the commitment 
    to leadership for now, feel free to apply as a standard volunteer!
</p>
<p>
    As a general overview, Bit by Bit’s mission is to diversify the community of ponderers and creators by 
    equipping the next generation with the tools of technology, thinking, and leadership to improve the world. 
    We support two programs — Uncommon Sense and Form and Function. Uncommon Sense immerses high schoolers in 
    critical thinking concepts to help them make more effective decisions, and Form and Function teaches middle 
    schoolers around the nation the core of web development. There is more information on our website that we 
    encourage you to familiarize yourself with.

    <h3>Team Co-Lead Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
        Although leading a team is often a complex and difficult process, there are a few key responsibilities 
        that we focus on. Team co-leads have a large say in the direction of their team, so their largest 
        responsibility is setting long-term goals and organizing members so they can achieve those goals. 
        From there, the goals should be broken down into understandable tasks that are delegated to each team 
        member to carry out effectively. Team co-leads should also be checking in with members on progress updates 
        and communicating with other leadership constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other responsibilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recruit and train new members for each team</li>
        <li>Keep team organized and directed towards a set goal</li>
        <li>Manage meetings and administrative work</li>
        <li>Attend weekly leadership meetings to give updates and discuss how things can be improved</li>
        <li>
            Have weekly meetings to update the team on progress, and make announcements, assign tasks, and 
            discuss future goals
        </li>
    </ul>

        BxB Central does the behind the scenes marketing, fundraising, software engineering, and website design. 
        The marketing team is the brains behind outreach, collaborations, social media, and more! Like all the 
        other teams in BxB Central, the team is small, but also extremely effective. There are currently around 
        6 team members, but that number fluctuates depending on where volunteers are needed most urgently. 
        Because our marketing is still in an experimental stage, there are countless marketing tactics that 
        Bit by Bit can explore as long as we have someone who is willing to put the time and effort into 
        researching and pursuing those avenues.

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>
            Bit by Bit is dedicated to giving students, often high schoolers, real project management experience. 
            We completely understand that many students have not had previous experience in something as specific 
            as leading a marketing team in another organization. However, we do require previous leadership 
            experience, whether that be within your school club or your local church group. It does not have to 
            be very formal or rigorous leadership, but we want to know that you have the ability to organize and 
            communicate with others, delegate tasks, and work towards a larger goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should also be familiar with social media and general outreach techniques. Again, we do expect for 
            you to have an abundance of previous knowledge on the inner workings of marketing. However, you should 
            be willing to put in the extra time and work to research marketing tactics and determine which ones 
            are the best fit for our organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will be asking for a reference on the application, but this reference does not need to be too 
            formal. We understand with current circumstances and also by nature of age, not everyone will have 
            previous work experience and we do not want that to stop anyone from applying. The reference can be 
            a teacher, mentor, or anybody else who you believe will be able to speak to your abilities as a team 
            player and leader along with providing insight into your organizational skills and work ethic.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an organization, we want to help you grow by giving you the tools needed to learn more about skills 
            ranging from leadership to marketing. Thus, we want to make sure you believe that the co-lead position 
            is one that you will be dedicated to and also enjoy. If you are not sure of your commitment in 
            co-leading our marketing team, we would love for you to apply for a standard position in the marketing 
            team or any other team you may be interested in!
