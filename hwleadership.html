<h1>Hello World Leadership Information</h1>
<!-- <p class="title-text"><strong>Applications are currently closed.</strong></p> -->
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Hello World is now searching for the next generation of managers! We are looking for dedicated volunteers
    to lead and run our summer camp program Hello World which is dedicated to teach web development to our
    underrepresented youth. The program aims to both excite and enlighten students
    who are not normally exposed to actual code. If you are not familiar with the program, please read about it
    <a href="{{ 'helloworld.html' | relative_url | remove: '.html' }}">here</a>. Explore our website to gain a sense
    of our organizationâ€™s mission and goal. Part of our mission is to
    provide leadership opportunities. The manager and assistant manager will have the unique opportunity to take
    the reins of a program that serves around a hundred of students and 20+ volunteers. Do not be intimidated if you have
    never directed a program before. We especially welcome high schoolers and college students to apply.

    <h3>Hello World Manager:</h3>
    <p>
        Our Hello World Manager is in charge of leading and setting the tone and direction of our program. To 
        lead Hello World, it takes a dedication, flexability, and communication skills. It takes someone who 
        is willing and able to manage students, parents, and volunteer effectively to run a program which 
        teaches middle school girls and non-binary youth how to code.
    </p>
    <p>
        The manager will be in charge of all interactions between parents, students, and Hello World. This
        involves student signing-ups, answering questions, solving problems, and any other necessary 
        communication. The manager is also responsible for organizing volunteers. This includes interviewing, 
        onboarding, leading meetings, and creating a welcoming and supportive environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The manager is the bridge between Hello World and all BxB Central. They will attend manager 
        meetings and interact with the marketing team, website team, fundraising team, software engineer 
        team, and HR.
    </p>
    <p>
        The position of manager offers numerous benefits. The manager will not only observe but lead a real
        business, seeing the behind-the-scenes work of nonprofits. They will learn and use all of the modern 
        platforms of small businesses such as Slack and Notion and meet with other managers to implement strategic plans to 
        lead the organization forwards. Feel free to have a dream for the program and go for it! Being part of Bit by Bit
        provides a community of like-minded peers, people who can offer advice, encouragement, and support.
        Interacting with the wide range of stakeholders involved with Hello World will allow your 
        communication skills to flourish. At the end of the year, the manager will have the satisfaction 
        of knowing that they made an impact on a large group of middle school students.
