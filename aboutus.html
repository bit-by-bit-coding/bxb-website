    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
        Bit by Bit Coding started with a problem, a bug in the programming community: a girl walked into the 
        engineering building at Lake Oswego High School, and she froze. She was the <em>only</em> girl. 
        <em>Again</em>. The same thing had happened to her last year. That meant one of two things: either, 
        sheâ€™d just experienced an event with less than a one-in-ten million chance of happening, <em>or</em> 
        there was a serious gender imbalance in STEM. Nobody else in the class seemed to notice anything. But 
        she saw it and felt it and got fed up with it until finally, she met a classmate with a similar story 
        who helped her do something about it. Midway through high school, in 2018, Sydney Von Arx and Selena 
        Zhang founded Bit by Bit Coding, a nonprofit dedicated to giving <em>everyone</em> the chance to code. 
        That summer, Bit by Bit ran its first iteration of its summer program, Hello World, that taught middle 
        school girls web development. The next year, Bit by Bit launched its year round program as clubs at the 
        middle and high schools.

    <p>
        In 2020, we had to move our programs online for the first time ever due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While 
        this came with a host of new challenges, it also brought new opportunities to reach students across 
        the globe. We expanded our vision to offer programs to hundreds of students and grew from simple web 
        development to more complex topics like machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also partnered with Stanford Effective Altruism to offer a seminar on critical thinking to high school 
        students. We wanted to empower them with the conscientiousness to discover the most pressing bugs in the 
        world around them and the agency to debug these problems and to create a better world, bit by bit.

    <h2>Our Organization</h2>
    <p>
        Bit by Bit is a student-led nonprofit located in Portland that started running programs in 2018 and incorporated
        in 2019.
        Our mission is to diversify the community of ponderers and creators by equipping the next generation
        with the tools of technology, thinking, and leadership to improve the world, bit by bit.

        <!--Hello World is run by a Portland nonprofit called Bit by Bit Coding. We started running programs in 2018, and
        incorporated in 2019. Our mission is to expand and diversify the programming community by equipping the next
        generation of programmers with the tools they need to master coding and leadership.-->

    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p>
        We strive for low-cost programs to teach and encourage students, especially girls
        and other underrepresented youths in the STEM community, to code, to examine the world, and to lead.
        We currently offer three programs: Hello World, Form and Function, and Uncommon Sense.
        Hello World is a summer camp aimed at teaching middle school girls the inner workings of websites.
        Form and Function is a free after-school program empowering middle schoolers with the tools of web development.
        Uncommon Sense allows high schoolers to examine the world critically and see things with a skeptical eye.
        For our paid programs, scholarships are readily available to ensure all can enjoy
        our programs.
        We also train student volunteers to adopt the responsibility, initiative, and dedication critical to strong leadership, all through hands-on learning.
        We started as a summer camp to teach middle school girls how to code, and the following year,
        we expanded to clubs for middle schools and high schools.
        In 2020, we also incorporated critical thinking as one of our services.

        <!--We provide low-cost and no-cost programs to teach and encourage people, especially girls and other youths
        underrepresented in the programming community, to code and to lead. We currently offer a summer program, Hello
        World, and two after school programs at Lake Oswego High School and Lake Oswego Junior High. Both after school
        programs are free to attend, and we make Hello World scholarships freely available to ensure the programs are as
        accessible as possible. In addition to sharing the gift of code, we train student volunteers through hands-on
        learning to
        adopt the responsibility, initiative, and dedication critical to strong leadership.-->
