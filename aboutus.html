    <h2>Our Organization</h2>
    <p>
        Bit by Bit is a student-led nonprofit located in Portland that started running programs in 2018 and incorporated
        in 2019.
        Our mission is to diversify the community of ponderers and creators by equipping the next generation
        with the tools of technology, thinking, and leadership to improve the world, bit by bit.

        <!--Hello World is run by a Portland nonprofit called Bit by Bit Coding. We started running programs in 2018, and
        incorporated in 2019. Our mission is to expand and diversify the programming community by equipping the next
        generation of programmers with the tools they need to master coding and leadership.-->

    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p>
        We strive for low-cost programs to teach and encourage students, especially girls
        and other underrepresented youths in the STEM community, to code, to examine the world, and to lead.
        We currently offer three programs: Hello World, Form and Function, and Uncommon Sense.
        Hello World is a summer camp aimed at teaching middle school girls the inner workings of websites.
        Form and Function is a free after-school program empowering middle schoolers with the tools of web development.
        Uncommon Sense allows high schoolers to examine the world critically and see things with a skeptical eye.
        For our paid programs, scholarships are readily available to ensure all can enjoy
        our programs.
        We also train student volunteers to adopt the responsibility, initiative, and dedication critical to strong leadership, all through hands-on learning.
        We started as a summer camp to teach middle school girls how to code, and the following year,
        we expanded to clubs for middle schools and high schools.
        In 2020, we also incorporated critical thinking as one of our services.

        <!--We provide low-cost and no-cost programs to teach and encourage people, especially girls and other youths
        underrepresented in the programming community, to code and to lead. We currently offer a summer program, Hello
        World, and two after school programs at Lake Oswego High School and Lake Oswego Junior High. Both after school
        programs are free to attend, and we make Hello World scholarships freely available to ensure the programs are as
        accessible as possible. In addition to sharing the gift of code, we train student volunteers through hands-on
        learning to
        adopt the responsibility, initiative, and dedication critical to strong leadership.-->
