        <h4 class="noslashes">About the program</h4>
        <details>
            <summary>What’s the difference between this program and the school-year program you offer?</summary>
            <p>
                The summer seminar is a much more intense, interactive, and rigorous program than our extracurricular offering. The summer program demands a much deeper level of intellectual engagement that includes projects, write-ups, and readings. We feel these aspects are necessary to prepare students to fully understand, utilize, and build off of the tools and concepts we teach. The summer program also fosters a community of talented students who see eachother every day for discussions, games, and collaborative projects. This kind of environment isn’t possible with a school-year program that only meets for an hour a week.

        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How does the schedule work?</summary>
            <p>
                We expect students to carve out plenty of time for or program during the weeks where it runs. The full schedule will be announced soon, but in general, there will be several meetings lasting 30-120 minutes throughout the day. The hope is that this model will minimize “Zoom fatigue.” Some activities will be mandatory, while others will be optional. There will also be asynchronous activities like meetings with groups of other students to work on projects, independent readings, time to write and think independently, and other challenges. We expect there to be about 1 hour of required real-time activities, 2 hours of optional real-time activities, and 2 hours of asynchronous work each weekday.

        <h4 class="noslashes">About recommendations</h4>
        <details>
            <summary>What if I have no one to recommend me?</summary>
            <p>
                If you do not know anyone suitable to recommend you (ie if you are homeschooled), please email <a href="mailto:{{site.contact.email}}">info@bitbybitcoding.org</a> explaining your situation.
            </p>

        <details>
            <summary>What if I want to recommend more than 10 students?</summary>
            <p>
                We recognize some instructors may know an unusual number of good candidates for our program (for example if they run a class on critical thinking). If you feel confident that more than 10 of your students would  be an excellent fit for Uncommon Sense, email <a href="mailto:{{site.contact.email}}">info@bitbybitcoding.org</a> briefly explaining your circumstances.

            <summary>What kind of students should I recommend?</summary>
            <p>
                Things that might make students a good fit for Uncommon Sense include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Having agency: when faced with a challenge, do they come up with and pursue their own solutions without being prompted or told to do so? Do they work on ambitious projects on their own?</li>
                <li>Carefully thinking through their values and actions: when they make important decisions, do they know precisely why they are making them?</li>
                <li>A tendency to optimize for important goals: when they want to do something, do they plan out their actions and consider many options? When shown a better way to do a difficult task, do they adopt the new method? When they decide how to use their time or resources, do they think about the alternative ways they could use these resources?</li>
                <li>An affinity for truth: do they seek out ideas that challenge their opinions? If they find evidence that contradicts their opinions, do they eagerly change their mind? Do they enjoy learning end exploration?</li>
                <li>Interest in rationality and cognition: do they want to improve their thinking? Do they enjoy talking about cognitive biases, or reading about psychology, economics, AI, cognitive science, philosophy, or a related subject?</li>
                <li>A desire to make the world better: do they have a drive to achieve some lofty goal to improve the world? Do they care about the details of this plan and are they taking steps to achieve it?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A good applicant probably possesses at least three of these traits, though there are sure to be plenty of exceptions. These are merely guidelines.

            <summary>Why do you require teacher recommendations to apply?</summary>
            <p>
                Our program is not suitable for all students. The pace is fast, the questions are tough, and the work is demanding. We need students who thrive in tackling difficult questions, who value science and knowledge, and who actually want to learn the material we offer rather than to collect a name for their resume.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, trying to figure out which students will thrive in our program is a difficult task.
            </p>
            <p>
                We could require students to write long essays and wax poetical about bayesian reasoning, but high school students are already inundated with application essays to write, and the best essays tend to only be a sign of good writing ability (and access to good education, familiarity with Standard American English rather than African American Vernacular English, etc). Not of the holistic kind of student we seek.
            </p>
            <p>
                We could look at test scores, but these measure privilege and test-taking ability as much as they measure academic prowess or intellect. Moreover, many students haven’t taken these exams, and they don’t capture the traits we’re looking for very well.
            </p>
            <p>
                We could look at grades, but these can vary widely between schools, and again might reflect access to tutors and other resources more than inherent ability. Plus, grades also don’t encompass the traits we are looking for too well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instructors already have a holistic view of their students, and we trust their judgement much more than any other metric. Applying this simple filter prevents students who aren’t a good fit from needlessly filling out the application, and might encourage students who are a good fit but feel insecure about their talents to apply. Obviously instructor recommendations are not a perfect metric, but they’re the best we have at the moment.
