        <details>
            <summary>What about trans/gender-nonconforming youths?</summary>
            <p>
                They are all welcome! Hello World aims to support all genders that are underrepresented in the
                programming community.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you need any previous experience with coding to participate in Hello World?</summary>
            <p>
                No! This program is designed for people with no previous exposure to web development at all. You do
                not
                need to be a computer whiz or a geeky person (though if you are, that’s great). All you need is a
                willingness to learn and try new things.

        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you teach WordPress/Wix/Weebly/ any other platform?</summary>
            <p>
                Nope! We teach pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! We don’t even use any libraries or frameworks. We
                feel it
                is essential to understand these core components of the web before using any tools built on top of
                them.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What if you already know how to program?</summary>
            <p>No worries; we’ll give you plenty of challenging tasks, no matter your skill level.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Why is it limited to only girls?</summary>
            <p>
                We believe learning to code is a great experience for anyone, but we only have the resources to
                teach a
                limited number of students. Many camps exist already where boys can learn to program, and, while
                girls
                are technically allowed at these camps (and it’s always great when they attend them!) many find it
                very
                intimidating and isolating to be one of the only females in the room. According to the <a
                    href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-gender">2019
                    StackOverflow
                    developer survey</a>, 92.1% of professional developers are male. For the 7.5% that are female,
                they
                must face a workplace where all their mentors, peers, and bosses are men. I can speak from
                experience as
                the only woman in many classes I’ve taken; it’s hard. Girls are actually as good (some studies even
                suggest better) programmers than guys, and at young ages they share the same level of interest. But,
                in
                middle school, they start to lose interest in programming and turn to more traditionally female
                roles.
                We aim to change that by showing girls how fun, useful, and powerful programming can be! So, sorry
                boys,
                but it’s time to give the girls a turn.

            <summary>Will there be a snack?</summary>
            <p>Yes! We will have allergy and special-diet friendly options.</p>
        </details> -->
        <details>
            <summary>Do you provide computers?</summary>
            <p>
                Computer access is required in order to participate. However, because camp is now online, we are
                unable
                to provide laptops to students. If you have a Chromebook or other personal computer, please make
                sure
                parental restrictions aren’t too tight on the laptop. Sometimes excessive restrictions can disable
                tools
                that are commonly used for programming. To test if restrictions are too tight, open a browser and
                press
                command (or control) + shift + i. If nothing happens, the restrictions are likely too tight.
