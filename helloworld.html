        <p><strong>Important Note: </strong> Registration is closed, but we'll be running the program again next
            year! Feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:{{site.contact.email}}">{{site.contact.email}}</a>

        <p><strong>What: </strong>
            Hello World is a one-week summer camp for motivated girls to learn to code their own
            websites. In this camp, we will introduce students to the heart of HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. Campers should walk away with the techniques, resources, and passion to continue
            tinkering with code. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML/CSS Session: </strong><br>
                <p>This session moves slower and will provide a more gentle introduction. Girls will develop a deep understanding of HTML and CSS and create their own customized webpage. Girls will also have the option to try JavaScript or to learn how to add animation to their websites. August 3rd-7th.

            </li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript Session: </strong><br>
                <p>A fast-and-furious dive into JavaScript and all participants will make their own simple game. This session will move at a faster pace and is better suited for those more familiar with technology. Prior programming experience is not required but is encouraged. August 10th-14th.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Who: </strong>Girls in grades 5-8 (rising 6-9). Coding experience not
            necessary,
            but always welcome. It is strongly recommended that younger girls, those who may
            want to
            take things more slowly, and those who are completely unfamiliar with technology
            sign up
            for the first session. Those who are older, crave a challenge, and are more
            comfortable
            with technology (though they may not necessarily have programming experience) are
            encouraged to sign up for the second session.

        <h3>FAQs</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>What about trans/gender-nonconforming youths?</summary>
            <p>
                They are all welcome! Hello World aims to support all genders that are underrepresented in the
                programming community.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you need any previous experience with coding to participate in Hello World?</summary>
            <p>
                No! This program is designed for people with no previous exposure to web development at all. You do
                not
                need to be a computer whiz or a geeky person (though if you are, that’s great). All you need is a
                willingness to learn and try new things.

        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you teach (WordPress/Wix/Weebly/any other platform)?</summary>
            <p>
                Nope! We teach pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! We don’t even use any libraries or frameworks. We
                feel it
                is essential to understand these core components of the web before using any tools built on top of
                them.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What if you already know how to program?</summary>
            <p>No worries; we’ll give you plenty of challenging tasks, no matter your skill level.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Why is it limited to only girls?</summary>
            <p>
                We believe learning to code is a great experience for anyone, but we only have the resources to
                teach a
                limited number of students. Many camps exist already where boys can learn to program, and, while
                girls
                are technically allowed at these camps (and it’s always great when they attend them!) many find it
                very
                intimidating and isolating to be one of the only females in the room. According to the <a
                    href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-gender">2019
                    StackOverflow
                    developer survey</a>, 92.1% of professional developers are male. For the 7.5% that are female,
                they
                must face a workplace where all their mentors, peers, and bosses are men. I can speak from
                experience as
                the only woman in many classes I’ve taken; it’s hard. Girls are actually as good (some studies even
                suggest better) programmers than guys, and at young ages they share the same level of interest. But,
                in
                middle school, they start to lose interest in programming and turn to more traditionally female
                roles.
                We aim to change that by showing girls how fun, useful, and powerful programming can be! So, sorry
                boys,
                but it’s time to give the girls a turn.

            <summary>Will there be a snack?</summary>
            <p>Yes! We will have allergy and special-diet friendly options.</p>
        </details> -->
        <details>
            <summary>Do you provide computers?</summary>
            <p>
                Computer access is required in order to participate. However, because camp is now online, we are
                unable
                to provide laptops to students. If you have a Chromebook or other personal computer, please make
                sure
                parental restrictions aren’t too tight on the laptop. Sometimes excessive restrictions can disable
                tools
                that are commonly used for programming. To test if restrictions are too tight, open a browser and
                press
                command (or control) + shift + i. If nothing happens, the restrictions are likely too tight.
