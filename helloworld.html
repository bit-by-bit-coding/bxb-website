        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <p><strong>Important Note: </strong> Registration is now open!</p>
        <p><strong>What: </strong>
            Hello World is a two-week online summer camp for motivated middle school girls and non-binary youth to learn to code their own websites.
            In this camp, we will introduce students to the heart of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Campers should walk away
            with the techniques, resources, and passion to continue tinkering with their projects. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML/CSS Weeks: </strong><br>
                <p>This session introduces the core of HTML and CSS. Students will develop a deep understanding of HTML
                    and CSS and create their own customized webpage. Click <a
                        href="https://codesandbox.io/s/hw-website-example-czhb3?file=/index.html">here</a> to see a sample project for this session
                    and the code behind it!</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript Weeks: </strong><br>
                <p>A dive into JavaScript where all participants will make their own simple hangman game. To be able to
                    sign up for this session, the student must have previous knowledge of HTML and CSS, either through
                    our HTML and CSS session or other means.

        <p><strong>Who: </strong>Girls and non-binary youth in grades 5-8 (rising 6-9). Coding experience not
            necessary,
            but always welcome. <br> To only sign up for our JavaScript sessions, the student must have previous

        <h3>FAQs</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>What about trans/gender-nonconforming youths?</summary>
            <p>
                They are all welcome! Hello World aims to support all genders that are underrepresented in the
                programming community.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you need any previous experience with coding to participate in Hello World?</summary>
            <p>
                No! This program is designed for people with no previous exposure to web development at all. You do
                not
                need to be a computer whiz or a geeky person (though if you are, that’s great). All you need is a
                willingness to learn and try new things.
            </p>

            <summary>I have a 4th grader who really wants to sign up.</summary>
            <p>Email <a href="mailto:{{site.contact.email}}">{{site.contact.email}}</a>.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you teach (WordPress/Wix/Weebly/any other platform)?</summary>
            <p>
                Nope! We teach pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! We don’t even use any libraries or frameworks. We
                feel it
                is essential to understand these core components of the web before using any tools built on top of
                them.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What if you already know how to program?</summary>
            <p>No worries; we’ll give you plenty of challenging tasks, no matter your skill level.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Why is it limited to only girls?</summary>
            <p>
                We believe learning to code is a great experience for anyone, but we only have the resources to
                teach a
                limited number of students. Many camps exist already where boys can learn to program, and, while
                girls
                are technically allowed at these camps (and it’s always great when they attend them!) many find it
                very
                intimidating and isolating to be one of the only females in the room. According to the <a
                    href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-gender">2019
                    StackOverflow
                    developer survey</a>, 92.1% of professional developers are male. For the 7.5% that are female,
                they
                must face a workplace where all their mentors, peers, and bosses are men. I can speak from
                experience as
                the only woman in many classes I’ve taken; it’s hard. Girls are actually as good (some studies even
                suggest better) programmers than guys, and at young ages they share the same level of interest. But,
                in
                middle school, they start to lose interest in programming and turn to more traditionally female
                roles.
                We aim to change that by showing girls how fun, useful, and powerful programming can be! So, sorry
                boys,
                but it’s time to give the girls a turn.

            <summary>Will there be a snack?</summary>
            <p>Yes! We will have allergy and special-diet friendly options.</p>
        </details> -->
        <details>
            <summary>Do you provide computers?</summary>
            <p>
                Computer access is required in order to participate. However, because camp is now online, we are
                unable
                to provide laptops to students. If you have a Chromebook or other personal computer, please make
                sure
                parental restrictions aren’t too tight on the laptop. Sometimes excessive restrictions can disable
                tools
                that are commonly used for programming. To test if restrictions are too tight, open a browser and
                press
                command (or control) + shift + i. If nothing happens, the restrictions are likely too tight.

                listen and ask for imput from the campers including any recommendations from the kids on how
                the could improve their system. Overall amazing. I will be coming back for more camps.
