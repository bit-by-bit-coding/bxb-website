                                From world leaders deciding whether to launch nuclear missiles, to students deciding where to apply to college, turning information into effective decisions is hard, and it matters. Uncommon Sense is a program for inquisitive high schoolers interested in learning ways to challenge their beliefs and improve their decisions-making. We aim to teach not what to think, but how to think critically. To do this, we immerse students in the discoveries of cognitive science, statistics, philosophy, decision theory, and more, and we support students in applying these ideas to help solve global problems and achieve their own goals. </p>
