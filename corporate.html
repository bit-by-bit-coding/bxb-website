                    <p><strong>Who: </strong>Girls in grades 5-8 (rising 6-9). Coding experience not
                        necessary,
                        but always welcome. It is strongly recommended that younger girls, those who may
                        want to
                        take things more slowly, and those who are completely unfamiliar with technology
                        sign up
                        for the first session. Those who are older, crave a challenge, and are more
                        comfortable
                        with technology (though they may not necessarily have programming experience) are
                        encouraged to sign up for the second session.
