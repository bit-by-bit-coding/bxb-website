# bxb-website

Hi. this site is now written statically with jekyll.




## to run dev site locally
`bundle install`
`bundle exec jekyll serve`

note some dependencies cant deal with file paths that have spaces in them, so if you get an error on `bundle install`, double check that you did not download this repository into a folder path that contains spaces
