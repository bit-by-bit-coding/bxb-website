            <details>
                <summary>Bit by Bit Central</summary>
                <p><strong>What:</strong> The brains behind marketing, fundraising, and more!
                </p>
                <p><strong>Who:</strong> Anybody that wants to contribute to our mission and be the support behind
                    our
                    programs. There are several teams within BxB Central with a wide range of responsibilities, so
                    no
                    matter what your skill set is, we will have a task for you!
                </p>
                <p><strong>When:</strong> Unlike the programs, there is no set time and we are much more flexible
                    with
                    meetings and work.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Join a community of supportive, dedicated volunteers while earning
                    volunteer hours and gaining experience in whichever team you decide to join. Our mission is to
                    diversify the programming community, but we also want to provide you with invaluable leadership
                    skills!

                <summary>Form and Function</summary>
                <p><strong>What:</strong> Form and Function, an online afterschool program that teaches middle
                    schoolers
                    how to code an interactive website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bit by bit, students will learn
                    to
                    code!
                </p>
                <p><strong>Who:</strong> You! We’re looking for volunteers who know the basics of HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. A little programming experience is required but we are happy to teach more! We
                    provide
                    free training for coding instructors. Volunteers teach, write curriculum, and have fun.
                </p>
                <p><strong>When:</strong> The program will happen once a week for one hour, but the specific times
                    and
                    days of the week are TBD.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Gain loads of volunteer hours, join a group of programmers (and
                    friends),
                    and introduce middle schoolers to the power of code. We’ll teach you coding, communication, and
                    instructional skills so you can gain invaluable experience in these fields!
                </p>

            <details>
                <summary>Uncommon Sense</summary>
                <p><strong>What:</strong> Do you want to learn about the world? Question your beliefs? Help teach
                    others
                    to do the same? Volunteer for Uncommon Sense, a critical thinking program for high schoolers.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Who:</strong> Anyone with experience with rationality, cognitive science, probability
                    theory,
                    decision theory, etc. Or anyone willing to learn about these subjects. You should be
                    intrinsically
                    motivated to seek the truth, unafraid to be proven wrong, and skeptical of your beliefs.
                    Naturally, don’t volunteer if you would counterfactually spend your time on something that
                    generated
                    more utility.
                </p>
                <p><strong>When:</strong> The program will happen once a week for one hour, but the specific times
                    and
                    days of the week are TBD.</p>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Sharpen your thinking skills, learn about rationality, and help build
                    the
                    next generation of critical thinkers ready to improve the world!
                </p>
