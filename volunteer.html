    <h2>Hello World Volunteer Details</h2>

    <p><strong>What:</strong> Hello World, a summer camp that teaches middle school girls the basics of web development.
        Find out more at <a href="https://bitbybitcoding.org">https://bitbybitcoding.org</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Who:</strong> You! We’re looking for volunteers who know (or are willing to learn) the basics of HTML,
        CSS, and Javascript. <strong>Programming experience is appreciated but NOT required -- we provide free
            training!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>When:</strong> 2:00-5:00pm Aug. 3-7 and Aug. 10-14. <strong>You don’t have to come every day; just days
            that work for you!</strong> Expect to do at least one hour of volunteer training beforehand, or more if you
        don’t know how to code.</p>

    <p><strong>Sign up:</strong> <a href="https://bit.ly/bxbvolunteering">https://bit.ly/bxbvolunteering</a>. If you
        know anyone interested in attending the camp, please direct them to <a
            href="https://bit.ly/bxbinterestform">https://bit.ly/bxbinterestform</a>!</p>

    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Gain up to 25+ volunteer hours (or choose to do less), join a community of
        programmers, and empower girls to
        code. We’ll teach you invaluable coding and leadership skills for free, and you can gain loads of volunteer
        hours or a
        position on your resume while you’re at it.
