            our programs. There are several teams within BxB Central with a wide range of responsibilities,

            with meetings and work.

        <h2>Uncommon Sense</h2>
        <p><strong>What:</strong> Do you want to learn about the world? Question your beliefs? Help teach
            others

        <p><strong>Who:</strong> Anyone with experience with rationality, cognitive science, probability 
            theory, decision theory, etc. Or anyone willing to learn about these subjects. You should be 
            intrinsically motivated to seek the truth, unafraid to be proven wrong, and skeptical of your beliefs. <br>
            Naturally, don’t volunteer if you would counterfactually spend your time on something that generated 
            more utility.
        </p>
        <p><strong>When:</strong> 
            Meetings from 3:30-5:15pm Pactifc Time Wednesdays, as well as additional sporadic meetings.
