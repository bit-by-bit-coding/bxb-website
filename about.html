            <strong>Sydney Von Arx</strong>
            <p>I am Sydney Von Arx, and I love to code! I’m a computer science major at Stanford. I have
                experience with eight programming languages. I have completed three computer science-related
                internships and built several programs and apps. My real specialty, though, is web
                development.
                One of the few things I love more than coding is teaching!

            <strong>Devin Von Arx</strong>
            <p>I have always enjoyed computers. After many years of  coding, I joined Bit By Bit in 2019 as a volunteer. 
                Since then, I have helped run all three of our coding programs (middle school, high school, and summer). 
                I currently coordinate the Form and Function after-school coding program. 
                I want to help people see the beauty behind the binary in coding.

            <strong>Lucia Zhang</strong>
            <p>Hi! Compared to many people I know, I didn’t start coding until sophomore year due to an 
                irrational fear of coding. However, with a lot of guidance, 
                coding has become one of my most intriguing hobbies. 
                I joined Bit By Bit in 2020, working extensively to develop our Hello World summer camp. 
                My current focus is on directing Bit By Bit Central and all of its many wonderful teams. 
                I want to Bit By Bit to be a strong community where students can learn to code, teach, and lead!
            </p>

            <strong>Selena Zhang</strong>
            <p>I’m Selena Zhang; I'm an avid web developer and love to teach and learn from others! Next year, I plan to
                study computer science at MIT, but in eighth grade, I was the only girl in my computer science class,
                and I felt discouraged and alienated. I want other girls to have a different experience, so I’ve devoted
                hundreds of hours to teaching after-school programs throughout high school.

    <h2>Our Organization</h2>
    <p>
        Bit By Bit is a Portland nonprofit that started running programs in 2018 and incorporated in 2019. 
        Our mission is to diversify the community of ponderers and creators by equipping the next generation 
        with the tools of technology, thinking, and leadership to improve the world, bit by bit. 

        <!--Hello World is run by a Portland nonprofit called Bit by Bit Coding. We started running programs in 2018, and
        incorporated in 2019. Our mission is to expand and diversify the programming community by equipping the next
        generation of programmers with the tools they need to master coding and leadership.-->

    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p>
        We strive for low-cost programs to teach and encourage students, especially girls 
        and other underrepresented youths in the STEM community, to code, to examine the world, and to lead. 
        We currently offer three programs: Hello World, Form and Function, and Uncommon Sense. 
        Hello World is a summer camp aimed at teaching middle school girls the inner workings of websites. 
        Form and Function is a free after-school program empowering middle schoolers with the tools web development. 
        Uncommon Sense allows high schoolers to examine the world critically and see things with a skeptical eye. 
        For our paid programs, we ensure that scholarships are readily available to ensure all can enjoy 
        our programs. 
        In addition to sharing the gift of code and knowledge, we train student volunteers through 
        hands-on learning to adopt the responsibility, initiative, and dedication critical to strong leadership. 
        We started as a summer camp to teach middle school girls how to code, and the following year, 
        we expanded to clubs for middle schools and high schools. 
        In 2020, we also incorporated critical thinking as one of our services. 

        <!--We provide low-cost and no-cost programs to teach and encourage people, especially girls and other youths
        underrepresented in the programming community, to code and to lead. We currently offer a summer program, Hello
        World, and two after school programs at Lake Oswego High School and Lake Oswego Junior High. Both after school
        programs are free to attend, and we make Hello World scholarships freely available to ensure the programs are as
        accessible as possible. In addition to sharing the gift of code, we train student volunteers through hands-on
        learning to
        adopt the responsibility, initiative, and dedication critical to strong leadership.-->
