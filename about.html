            <strong>Sydney Von Arx</strong>
            <p>I am Sydney Von Arx, and I love to code! I’m a computer science major at Stanford. I have
                experience with eight programming languages. I have completed three computer science-related
                internships and built several programs and apps. My real specialty, though, is web
                development.
                One of the few things I love more than coding is teaching!

            <strong>Selena Zhang</strong>
            <p>I’m Selena Zhang; I'm an avid web developer and love to teach and learn from others! Next year, I plan to
                study computer science at MIT, but in eighth grade, I was the only girl in my computer science class,
                and I felt discouraged and alienated. I want other girls to have a different experience, so I’ve devoted
                hundreds of hours to teaching after-school programs throughout high school.

    <h2>Our Organization</h2>
    <p>
        Hello World is run by a Portland nonprofit called Bit by Bit Coding. We started running programs in 2018, and
        incorporated in 2019. Our mission is to expand and diversify the programming community by equipping the next
        generation of programmers with the tools they need to master coding and leadership.

    </p>
    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p>
        We provide low-cost and no-cost programs to teach and encourage people, especially girls and other youths
        underrepresented in the programming community, to code and to lead. We currently offer a summer program, Hello
        World, and two after school programs at Lake Oswego High School and Lake Oswego Junior High. Both after school
        programs are free to attend, and we make Hello World scholarships freely available to ensure the programs are as
        accessible as possible. In addition to sharing the gift of code, we train student volunteers through hands-on
        learning to
        adopt the responsibility, initiative, and dedication critical to strong leadership.
