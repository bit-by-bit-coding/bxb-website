    <h2>Meet our Leads</h2>
    <p class="centertext">
        Our board focuses on creating a strategy for growth and managing larger organization-level tasks. <br>
        Our coordinators organize, plan, and lead the three branches of Bit by Bit to make them the best 
        they can possibly be. <br>
        Team Leads each run a smaller team within BxB Central. They are the brains behind many of our organization's 
        operations, training new volunteers, organizing their teams, and constantly improving what they do.

                I am Sydney Von Arx, and I love to code, learn about weird ideas, and maximize utility! I’m a computer
                science major at Stanford. I also help run
                <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/ea/">Stanford Effective Altruism</a> and work with the

            <strong>Devin Von Arx</strong>
            <p>I have always enjoyed computers. After many years of coding, I joined Bit By Bit in 2019 as a volunteer.
                Since then, I have helped run all three of our coding programs (middle school, high school, and summer).
                I currently coordinate the Form and Function after-school coding program.
                I want to help people see the beauty behind the binary in coding.

            <strong>Lucia Zhang</strong>
            <p>Hi! Compared to many people I know, I started coding pretty late due to an irrational fear of coding, but
                it has become one of my most intriguing hobbies.
                I joined Bit By Bit in 2020, working extensively to develop our Hello World summer camp.
                I currently direct Bit By Bit Central and hope to make it a strong community where students can learn,
                teach, and lead!

            <strong>Selena Zhang</strong>
            <p>I’m Selena Zhang; I'm an avid web developer and love to teach and learn from others! Next year, I plan to
                study computer science at MIT, but in eighth grade, I was the only girl in my computer science class,
                and I felt discouraged and alienated. I want other girls to have a different experience, so I’ve devoted
                hundreds of hours to teaching after-school programs throughout high school.
