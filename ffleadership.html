<h1>Form and Function Leadership Information</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Form and Function is searching for new leaders! We are looking for volunteers to join us in running a program
    dedicated to democratizing coding for middle schoolers. The program aims to both excite and enlighten students
    who are not normally exposed to actual code. If you are not familiar with the program, please read about it
    <a href="{{ 'formfunction.html' | relative_url | remove: '.html' }}">here</a>. Explore our website to gain a sense
    of our organizationâ€™s mission and goal. Part of our mission is to
    provide leadership opportunities. The director and assistant director will have the unique opportunity to take
    the reins of a program that serves hundreds of students and 20+ volunteers. Do not be intimidated if you have
    never directed a program before. We especially welcome high schoolers and college students to apply.

    <h3>Form and Function Director:</h3>
    <p>
        The Form and Function Director will lead the program, setting the tone and direction. Leading Form and
        Function
        requires creativity, commitment, and communication skills. The program needs someone who can manage
        students,
        parents, and volunteers effectively. They will be responsible for inspiring the next generation of computer
        programmers. Upon successful completion in June, they will receive a bonus of $2,000.
    </p>
    <p>
        The director will be in charge of all interactions between parents, students, and Form and Function. This
        involves student signing-ups, answering questions, solving problems, and any other necessary communication.
        The
        director is also responsible for organizing volunteers. This includes interviewing, onboarding, leading
        meetings, and creating a welcoming and supportive environment. They will create the volunteer placement in
        homerooms for each week, deciding what homerooms are needed on a given week and who will be responsible for
        teaching them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The director is the bridge between Form and Function and all BxB Central. They will attend director meetings
        and
        interact with the marketing team, website team, fundraising team, software engineer team, and HR.
    </p>
    <p>
        The position of director offers numerous benefits. The director will not only observe but lead a real
        business,
        seeing the behind-the-scenes work of nonprofits. They will learn and use all of the modern platforms of
        small
        businesses such as Slack and Notion and meet with other directors to implement strategic plans to lead the
        organization forwards. Feel free to have a dream for the program and go for it! Being part of Bit by Bit
        provides a community of like-minded peers, people who can offer advice, encouragement, and support.
        Interacting
        with the wide range of stakeholders involved with Form and Function will allow your communication skills to
        flourish. At the end of the year, the director will have the satisfaction of knowing that they made an impact
        on a large group of middle school students.
