<h1>Homeroom Levels</h1>
<p>
    Form and Function operates using Homeroom Levels, each of which teaches different lanuages and concepts.
    A homeroom level is in no way an indication of skill but of what is being taught. 
    Once a student has grasped everything the Homeroom Level offers, they will proceed into the next to learn even more.
    This allows students to come in and out of our program but it is best for students to attend weekly.
    To learn more about what is taught in each Homeroom, please look below.
