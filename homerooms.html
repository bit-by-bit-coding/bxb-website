<h1>Homeroom Levels</h1>

<h2>What is a Homeroom?</h2>
<p>
    We want to make sure every student receives exactly the right amount of challenge every day. 
    No matter what your previous experience or preferred learning speed, we have a curriculum 
    and projects to accommodate it! We’ve broken web development into six different homerooms, 
    and there’s one that’s just right for everyone.
</p>
<p>
    Each homeroom is a breakout room on Zoom where we will teach a set of skills at a specific coding level. 
    Students will start in a homeroom that matches their initial knowledge. Throughout the year, they will 
    migrate through every stage, learning new skills in each one and leveling up.
